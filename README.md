# YouTube-Transcript-Scraping
Using PyTube to scrape and clean transcripts on YouTube

This script was first written in January 2021 for a pet project of sentiment analysis of CountraPoints' script (because I'm a huge fan). I might pick it up again someday so I'm storing the scraping part here for safekeeping. The code is not the neatest but it worked at the time.  

You will need to apply for a YouTube API and install PyTube.
