       "{0: ' (Requiem music) - Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush aside the empty wine bottles and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson is President for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile and I will not stop until I reach the gates of hell. (champagne cork pops) You know what, America, things have not gone well. We\\'re having a hard time, we are, between the plague, the quarantine, the oppressive policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising tide of fascism, the criminal negligence of a President who\\'s refused to admit the danger of a disease that killed 200,000 people and counting... Of course, there\\'s gonna be some Trumpet in comments saying, \"It\\'s not that big a deal, calm down. \"People die all the time.\" Funny that\\'s not what you said about... Benghazi! We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness, and unfortunately Uncle Joe is really not the man for the job. I was a Bernie supporter, and I regret not being more vocal about it when I had the chance. So this time I\\'m gonna say something. Because even though Biden is not my boy, I still think that dethroning Trump by electing Biden is the single most important thing any American can do right now. So allow me to make my case gorg. By now leftist Twitter has seen the title of this video and I\\'m sure they\\'re firing off hot takes as we speak. - [Tabby] Typical t-thot normie radlib endorses the electoral farce. Is this your leftist Queen of YouTube? Looks more like a rich Karen who\\'d rather complain about cancel culture than revolt against the neoliberal status quo. - Tabby-chan, Tabby-chan! You know what Tabitha? For once, I\\'m actually gonna take the bait. So this will be a conversation with the communist Twitter catgirl that lives in my brain, nya. I\\'m making this video because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so disillusioned with the System that they intend not to vote in this election. And yeah, some of them are probably Russian bots, but that\\'s fine, maybe I can win over the Russian bot vote. So I really do understand the perspective that Biden is not worth voting for because that was also my first reflex when he was nominated. But on reflection, I think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake. Don\\'t make me eat my bathroom tile, children. There\\'s probably asbestos in that tile. Because America\\'s so great even the floor is made of poison. Okay Tabby-chan, give me your worst. - [Tabby] I want free healthcare, student debt canceled, and worker ownership of the means of production. Biden won\\'t give us any of that and I don\\'t wanna vote for someone who won\\'t actually change things. - Well, listen Tabby-chan, no one of us want to vote for Joe Biden. I don\\'t wanna vote for Joe Biden any more than I wanna retile my bathroom, but sometimes a situation gets so toxic and so dangerous, well, you have no choice but to get your hands dirty. And in this election, I consider a vote for Biden primarily a vote against Trump. Voting for a politician is not necessarily the same as supporting the politician. I don\\'t think anyone should stan Joe Biden. I am not asking you to like, comment, and subscribe to Joe Biden\\'s OnlyFans, fascinating though I\\'m sure it is. - The president has a big stick. - To me, voting is more of a utilitarian calculation based on the likely consequences of each candidate winning. It\\'s not hero worship, it\\'s not choosing a person to have a beer with, it\\'s strategy. - [Tabby] Bad strategy. Biden is no better than Trump. The Dems are just Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility. - Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it is simply not true that there\\'s no difference between them and the Republicans. I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary. But there\\'s a lot of things Trump did that Hillary would not have done. Things like, filling the supreme court with anti-abortion fanatics, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting to remove medical non-discrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling white nationalist militias very fine people and telling them to stand by, aspiring to be an autocratic dictator and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing a deadly pandemic in the name of delusional macho posturing. So sure, the Democrats suck and they\\'re libs, but it makes a real difference if they\\'re in control instead of Republicans, especially if you\\'re a woman, or LGBTQ, or a human who lives on the planet Earth. - [Tabby] So Biden will give us rainbow capitalism and streets named after Black Lives Matter, but he\\'ll do nothing to bring about systemic change. - Well Tabby-chan, I\\'m sorry to say I agree with you about that. I fully expect to vote for Biden and then protest the administration that I voted for. - [Tabby] So you sit here vote-shaming me and in the next breath admitting it won\\'t do anything. You\\'re a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote. - Tabby-chan, Tabby-chan. Look, I promise I\\'m not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade. Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote, they think you\\'re saying quit your job, abandon your family, retreat from society and fall into a deep slumber from which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib, before fleeing into the forest and re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch temple awaiting the return of Beelzebub. (cymbals cling) Voting doesn\\'t take that long. At most it takes one day. You can vote and do other things also. I guess you\\'re probably still mad about that white woman with the \"we\\'d be at brunch\" sign. And I feel you, though to be honest, I would eat a Louis XVI style armchair with a pair of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now. - [Tabby] Could you be any bougier? - Don\\'t call me bougie. I\\'m beyond bougie. When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie, I scoff at them openly. I\\'ve have enough of this radlib merchant class trying to abolish my fiefdom. - [Tabby] You\\'re a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine. Why should I listen to what you say? - Oh, you shouldn\\'t. I don\\'t know why anyone listens to me, honestly. But also I\\'m degenerate class traitor and, in my opinion, influencers should be the first against the wall. Honestly, I just wish you\\'d just guillotine me quickly and get it over with. You at least have to admire that about us libs. We have a remarkable willingness to have polite conversations with people who are trying to kill us. Speaking of which, we\\'ve been talking a lot about my plan but what is your plan Tabitha? - [Tabitha] Uh, protest, unionize, mutual aid, strikes... - So I totally agree, those are all good things to do. I\\'ve gone to protests myself this year myself, I\\'ve supported a mutual aid group. You\\'re right, voting won\\'t fix all our problems and it\\'s great to get involved in local things like that. But it still matters who\\'s on the supreme court and who\\'s leading the national response to the coronavirus. So in addition to whatever else you\\'re doing, vote. - [Tabby] Why participate in the charade of a farcical election? America is not democratic. It\\'s a rigged two-party corporatocracy.\" - (sighs) Well, I mean, (sighs) yeah. There\\'s a lot wrong with our elections, big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression, DC being disenfranchised. All of this should obviously should be changed. But I don\\'t think that in this moment, leftists boycotting the election is an effective form of protest. - [Tabby] Okay, but voting is for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit, ew. - Okay, it\\'s true that voting is not cool. It\\'s boring, it\\'s incrementalist, it doesn\\'t make you feel like you\\'re owning the libs or being edgier than your parents. But you could always vote in secret and maintain your radical image around your friends. Isn\\'t being involved in politics inherently not cool? Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things, people who place their hope in fallible human beings. All of which is very not cool. I feel like so much Internet politics, whether it\\'s radical or centrist, is just posturing. It\\'s showcasing that you\\'re funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through all the bullshit, the corrupt system, the electoral farce. But all you\\'re doing about it is sitting here shitposting and demeaning the people who are actually trying to accomplish what little can be accomplished. And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing are no different from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing. - [Tabby] Okay, but you, yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn\\'t believe in democracy. Why bother voting against someone who won\\'t leave office even if he loses? This ends in violence either way so we may as well smash. - Well, you\\'re right, I don\\'t expect Trump to go quietly. But if there\\'s a decisive Biden victory and it\\'s not some kind of vote-recount nightmare scenario, then I think the military will force Trump to leave. Don\\'t get me wrong Tabby-chan, times are tough. The president is a fascist. I think this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising than it\\'s ever been in my life. But if it comes to smashing, you\\'re gonna want allies. And for a lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory, and therefore, rejecting democracy itself, that would legitimize smashing. So you should still want every Biden vote you can get. - [Tabby] But capitalism is the root of the problems with our world. The whole system is broken and voting won\\'t change that. We don\\'t need a Democrat, we need to end capitalism. - Tabitha, capitalism is an epochal world economic order. When you say end capitalism, you\\'re talking about a tectonic shift in global politics that is so much bigger than all of us that I don\\'t really understand what course of action you\\'re recommending. Like before capitalism there was feudalism. And feudalism ended over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population and production, not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism. So won\\'t capitalism end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it? I don\\'t think that\\'s the kind of thing that can be accomplished by a small group of activists. And I say small group because, I\\'m sorry to break it to you, but the vast majority of Americans are not communists. I think a lot of Internet leftists have a vastly overinflated sense of how big and important they are. I fall prey to this myself, like I was so sure that Bernie was gonna win the primary, in part because when I looked at my timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support for Bernie and contempt for the mainstream Dems. But what I was seeing, and what we\\'re all seeing on our feeds, is a finely curated and very unrepresentative sample of the population. You have to remember that only 22% of Americans use Twitter at all. Most users rarely tweet, and 80% of tweets come from 10% of users. So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans. And it\\'s not a representative 2%. According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population in that they\\'re, on average, younger, more likely to identify as Democrats, more educated and higher income. And far-left hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller, even more unrepresentative sample within a sample. We\\'re talking about less than 0.1% of Americans. And that less than 0.1% does have an outsize influence because they\\'re prolific Tweeters and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform, which is why there\\'s so much discourse about cancel culture even though cancel culture is produced by a relatively tiny group of people. So if you wanna understand why even Democratic politicians cater to this retrograde soft conservatism, you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble. Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign and I enraged people\\'s dogs by knocking on their doors and ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls. And I really recommend that leftists try doing this for at least one election, even though it is the worst thing in the world and I hated it so much. You know, you have to listen to a lot of, \"I don\\'t want Barack Hussein Obummer \"redistributing my wealth!\" Okay Ronald, I\\'m pretty sure Obama\\'s not sending his death panels after your landscaping business but whatever. Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities of what your fellow Americans actually care about. And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people, I talked to union families, but I don\\'t think I talked to a single communist. Most people do not read theory. Most people are concerned primarily with themselves and their families. They want personal security and prosperity. And if you look at the talking points used by politicians, they reflect that. It\\'s why the right hammers on about ANTIFA so much, because it works. Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety. And this idea of ANTIFA looters and riots, it scares the shit out of people. Of course, in reality ANTIFA is not scary. Like I\\'ve met ANTIFA, and ANTIFA... ANTIFA is Ryan. It\\'s Ryan and his transgender furry anarchist friends. But look if what you want is socialism or even just social democracy, then you have a lot of work ahead of you in terms of outreach. You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness. But you don\\'t wanna do that because it requires you to stop owning the libs and start actually communicating with them. You have to build alliances with Facebook moms who ask ignorant questions like, \"What\\'s indigenous peoples\\' day?\" And who think Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the height of praxis, and who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing! You can\\'t let your radical queer friends catch you associating with mainstream normie libs, how very bourgeois. - [Tabby] But revolution. Revolution to end capitalism. Okay, so you\\'re saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution and overthrow the US government? That\\'s very valid. That\\'s super hecking valid. That\\'s extremely valid. I mean I guess I admire the ambition. Uh, just a couple quick follow up questions though, are you counting on the US military and police taking the side of the communists or is your plan to overpower them? Because unless you know something about the military that I don\\'t, I don\\'t think that much of the military is gonna defect to join a communist revolution. So there will have to be a war. Revolution doesn\\'t happen overnight. After the Russian Revolution, there was the Civil War from 1917 to 1923, so you are gonna need to raise a Red Army. Well, you can\\'t have a communist revolution without a Red Army, right? So how\\'s that going, Tabitha? How many weapons have you amassed? How many units have you trained? Why are we talking about this? Why am I even entertaining this notion? When the far-right talks about violence and overthrowing the government, they actually mean it. And you know they mean it because they have literal militias, the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo boys, they\\'re stockpiling weapons and training to use them. They have ex-military men in their ranks and connections to white supremacists within the police and military. Whereas when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter, it strikes me as ideation, not intent. Psychiatrists have this distinction between two kinds of suicidal thinking. So there\\'s intent which is when you have a plan for how you\\'re gonna do it, and then they have to commit you \\'cause you\\'re a danger to yourself. And then there\\'s ideation, which is you\\'re not actually gonna do it but you just have that inner monologue that\\'s constantly saying \"I just wanna die. \"There\\'s no joy for me left in this world. \"I just can\\'t stand it anymore. \"I just wanna end it all.\" Then my psychiatrist says, \"Well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro.\" And I say, \"Not again doctor. Not again.\" So right-wing extremist discourse is violent intent while leftist radical discourse often amounts to revolutionary ideation. It\\'s a kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics. - [Tabby] Well you can\\'t plan a revolution. Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice. - Yeah, so a riot is the language of the unheard. But what kind of language is it? What is the point of speaking through a riot, a protest or a strike? Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry? Or is the point not just to speak but to be heard? Heard by whomst? Who are you trying to persuade, the Globglogabgalab? No, you want be heard by people with power to change things. So it matters whether the people with power are likely to listen. This year the US has seen one of the biggest protest movements in history. And what has that accomplished? Well, at the moment we have a president promising to double down on law and order, on military police suppression, a president who told a room full of cops not to be too gentle with people they arrest. - And when you see these thugs being thrown to the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough. I said, \"Please don\\'t be too nice.\" - And let\\'s be clear, both Biden and \"Cop-mala\" have an ugly record when it comes to crime and policing. For most of his career, Biden called for more policing, which is the opposite of what we need right now. I\\'m right there with you Tabby-chan. But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse about policing and criminal justice. And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position. This years\\' Democratic platform includes things like stricter use-of-force standards, banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity, creating a registry of police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed, investing in crime prevention and social work. And is that good enough? No, it\\'s not good enough. But it\\'s a start, it\\'s progress. It shows that the Democrats are, at least, willing to listen to protests. When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961, he didn\\'t want to propose a civil rights bill because that would\\'ve been super unpopular with the Southern Democrats. But then 1963 happened and there were protests and uprisings all over the south and the March on Washington that summer, and Kennedy listened. - The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them. - He was moved by the protests, and he responded by introducing what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But what if Kennedy hadn\\'t been president in 1963? What if some fascist had been president? What if Trump had been president? We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act. So it does matter who\\'s president. It actually matters a lot. And please Tabby-chan, do not let a fascist win to own the libs. Goddamn it. Alright fam, let\\'s open a new tab. Go to vote.gov and enter your state. And yeah, I know this is boring but I\\'m trying to think about the tantrum Trump is gonna throw when an entire nation rejects him and I\\'m letting that motivate me. In some states you can still register, so register now if you still haven\\'t. If you\\'re voting in person, go to vote.org and find your polling place and make a plan for how you\\'re gonna get there. Make sure your phone is charged and you might wanna bring some snacks or even some friends. If you\\'re like me, you need to set an alarm so you don\\'t forget. And then just try not to get inconsolably high until after you\\'ve placed your vote. Because we\\'re all living through a year of hell. And I, for one, think that we all deserve to begin 2021 by collectively purging from our lives this swindling, pestilent doofus. Vote him out! (\"Lacrymosa, Mozart\\'s Requiem\" by Papalin)',\n",

The Punisher\\'s real name is Frank Castiglione but he changed it to Frank Castle, I guess \\'cause he\\'s ashamed of his Sicilian heritage. Disappointing. Frank Castle is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him an empty husk of a man whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge. Nyaa. There\\'s been a lot of TV and movie adaptations of \"The Punisher\" and as research for this video, I did watch all of them. And my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass as Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty in the sewers worshiping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash. You know, just like the police do. (police chatter on radio) Hi, I\\'m Nyatalie. Creator of \"Catrapoints\" and no, I\\'m not a catgirl. I\\'m a catwoman. I\\'m sorry you\\'re intimidated by that. Look I\\'m tired of only being valued for my petite, heterosexual body. I\\'d like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife and (piano music) as a woman with values. Just kidding, I\\'m trash. Let\\'s talk about justice, uwu. Justice is when I get lots of head pats, nyaa— The Punisher\\'s main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family. But once he gets revenge, he can\\'t stop killing because it\\'s the only thing that gives meaning to his shitty life. So he wages a one-man war on organized crime. But no matter how many bad guys he kills, it\\'s never enough because new criminals just come along and take the place of the old ones. It\\'s like a cycle where violence begets violence and nothing ever really changes. It\\'s almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime and punishment. But you know what? Let\\'s not overthink this. Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car. Great. Perfect. - Are we the baddies? - Look, maybe you\\'re assuming I\\'m one of these libtarded, ANTIFA-sympathizing, big government anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte, criticizing the police, even though I could never do a job 1/10 as difficult as theirs. And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct? This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee. There\\'s just nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose of the chemical you\\'re addicted to. They tried to make me go to rehab, I said, \"Nyaa, nyaa, nyaa.\" But you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor, the free marketplace of ideas gorg. And as a reasonable person, I\\'m sure you wouldn\\'t dismiss my argument just because I happen to enjoy head pats. As Socrates once said, \"Two plus two is four is equally true whether uttered by a philosopher king or a peasant knave.\" Or a nekomimi. Kawaii desu! (laughs) Is this problematic? Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it. This is beyond cringe. This is cursed, children, cursed. So actually Socrates didn\\'t say this quote, I just made it up but that just proves the point I\\'m making. so maybe you should hear me out, nyaa. I\\'m making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared on social media spurring on a movement to abolish police and prisons. And at the same time, there\\'s a growing culture of online vigilantism where justice is taken into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior. All of this raises a lot of questions, questions like, what should the consequences be for bad behavior? Who should impose these consequences? And under what circumstances and for what purpose? If we were to abolish police and prisons, what would take their place? Oh my god, these contacts. I\\'m literally doing a whole video with f*cking sideways cat eyes. Ridiculous. Why don\\'t we start with the basics and ask ourselves, what is justice, Socrates? It\\'s a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years with no conclusive answers. I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video \\'cause the philosophers were dummies and I am very smart, nyaa. Ra ra Rasputin. One, revenge. \"The Punisher\" represents a particular idea about what justice is symbolized by the skull he wears on his t-shirt so the bad guys know they\\'re about to get punished. \"The Punisher\\'s view is that justice means harming people who harm people. An eye for an eye. This is called retributive justice. The idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment in proportion to their crime. It\\'s a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is because it\\'s rooted in our instinct to strike back at someone who\\'s harmed us. Social animals like humans and chimpanzees often practice revenge, probably because it serves an evolutionary function. If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas and you don\\'t get revenge then other monkeys will learn that you\\'re a doormat monkey. But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don\\'t know, letting her boyfriend pick parasites out of your fur then that sends a message to the other monkeys that it is not profitable to mess with you. So our little monkey brains have evolved a taste for vengeance. And even in cases where it doesn\\'t actually benefit us, our desire for retribution is strong. And our little monkey brains reward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsis when justice of this kind is served. So of course there\\'s a lot of content out there devoted to scratching this itch. For example, there\\'s a subreddit called r/JusticeServed with 1 1/2 million subscribers. I first found JusticeServed when the popular feed showed me this post of two teenage thieves, stripped naked, humiliated and photographed as punishment and all this celebrated under the heading \"Police Justice.\" In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police, the description of the community was, now with 20% more police brutality! Fun fact, this ain\\'t it, chief. Period, full stop. That\\'s the tweet. Of course I subscribed to JusticeServed right away thinking, someone should be keeping an eye on these people. Here\\'s a typical Justice Served post, woman sets P-E-D-O husband on fire after catching him R-*-P-E seven-year-old daughter titled, this man got what he deserved. Instant regret, predator exposed. To be honest, when I wrote this part of this script, I forgot I was gonna be wearing cat ears. I\\'m really out here trying to have a conversation about immolating sex offenders while dressed like an aging bargain bin, Belle Delphine impersonator. Well, dress for the job you want. I mean, whomst amongst us wouldn\\'t set their husband on fire under those circumstances, right? Let\\'s look at the comments on that post though. Let\\'s read the room. She\\'s a hero in my opinion. Should have had it live on television. Give her a medal. Give her two medals. So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze, but you know, there\\'s always a couple buzzkills in there whining as usual about \"oh, maybe we shouldn\\'t be cheering on burning people alive with no due process and no evidence.\" \"Lots of men like to f*ck my wife \\'cause I\\'m too busy crying about due process\" But those people get shouted down pretty fast. They get called pedo-symps. (laughs) Pedo-symps. So JusticeServed is a community for people to gather together and bond over our shared love of extra-judicial violence. But of course there\\'s always someone who takes it a little too far. On this video of a thief being kicked in the head until his face is a bloody pulp, one commenter says, \"That\\'s a justice boner for me. I dream of the day I catch the thieves that stole from me and kick the life out of them.\" Criminal fail, prank gone wrong. So when the righteous zeal for justice becomes the cloak of blood lust, that is off-putting to some people. As one disgruntled former JusticeServed subscriber put it, I wanted to see stories and videos of assholes getting their comeuppance. Instead I got bombarded with an angry, toxic, moral absolutism. Everything is black and white with them. If you don\\'t support mutilating someone beyond repair, then you must support giving them a slap on the wrist and letting them fuck your wife. Unsubscribed. But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch \"videos of assholes getting their comeuppance.\" I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying some version of this type of content. There\\'s a lot of sub genres. You\\'ve got Justice Porn, Play Stupid Games Win Stupid Prizes, Instant Karma, Bad Parking Revenge, Predator Poaching. - Why don\\'t you just shoot me? Serial killer sentenced to death and the whole train clapped, instant justice was served, karma fails, stupid people getting what they deserved, karma! A lot of this content has kind of a right wing feel to it. Unmarked police justice, criminal gets shot after fighting cop, home invader takes shotgun blast to the balls, Arizona, just Arizona. What about more is there to say? Arizona. Justice served, punished. It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about how they\\'re gonna kill home intruders with the gun they keep in the bathroom. But I don\\'t think this longing for retribution is distinctively right-wing. Left-wing people have the exact same emotional response. They just have it in different situations. Think about the jubilation on Twitter when they get a racist Karen fired. Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man in front of an apartment building? Karma. And she got her husband fired. Dumb bitch really should have minded her business. Love to see it. She will probably end up with community service and a fine, but I would love to see her in jail for at least six months. Firing them was not enough. Life in prison! (laughs) Life (clap) in (clap) prison (clap)! An example I personally enjoy is that video of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his power to sexually assault a series of Black women, crying in court as he\\'s sentenced to serve 263 years in prison. He just cannot believe that he\\'s actually facing consequences for this. And of course there was the much savored vigilante punching of N-A-Z-I Richard Spencer. Let\\'s watch it now. Please try not to enjoy this. Remember, this is purely for educational, monetizable purposes. - It\\'s uh Pepe, he\\'s become kind of a symbol- (crowd noises) - That was informative. But let\\'s be honest, the reason that video was so popular is people just enjoyed watching an N-A-Z-I get what he deserves. Justice served. Punished. Smashing. Very happy gay sounds, uwu. Remember to smash Subscribe. So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still basically a situational form of sadism, of schadenfreude. The satisfaction of justice served is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing the suffering of someone who deserves it. Now the phrase \"deserves it\" is doing a lot of work here. The correct use of that phrase is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person and someone who\\'s hiding bodies in the crawl space. It puts the lotion on its skin, nyaa. But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves. It\\'s why we love stories about revenge. Stories like \"Mean Girls\", \"The Crow\", \"Old Boy\", \"Titus Andronicus\" and \"Matilda\". - Much too good for children! Revenge is such a popular plot line because it\\'s easy for people to identify with a revenge-seeking protagonist. And it\\'s just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles of violence. This technique was used in one of the first books ever, \"The Odyssey\" by Homer. I stole this copy from my high school and I stole this copy from my college. I still just read the SparkNotes. Well, let\\'s read it now. See, I knew this would be useful someday. God, he\\'s such a f*ckboy. What does Athena see in this man? He must be really hot. Okay, I\\'m ready for my book report. So the hero of the story is Odysseus and the whole book is him trying to get home to the island of Ithaca after... Okay, so in the prequel, Odysseus\\' shitty friend, Menelaus throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually attracted to how dare she? So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would do and blowing off some steam at a Femboy Symposium. Anyway, when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is full of men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry his wife. So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife\\'s suitors as payback and then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors and he has them all hanged. And there\\'s one suitor, Melanthius, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose and feet and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs. And reading this, I guess I find myself asking was this really necessary? Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is maybe workshop this? I mean, super unlikable protagonist, really kind of kills it for me. I guess it\\'s a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable \\'cause men love hearing about assholes. That\\'s why they watch my channel. But the crazy thing is I don\\'t think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole. The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors and to his uh... his slaves. Yikes, disappointing. Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves. It isn\\'t a good look. Wow, this blew up. I don\\'t have a SoundCloud, give me money- Oh my God, this contact is fully horizontal. This is the last time we\\'re doing cat eye contacts. F*ck this! It just seems disproportionate, you know. Like it\\'s not even an eye for an eye because the suitors didn\\'t kill anyone. They were basically just rude to Odysseus. But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context. They came into his home and they disrespected his wife and probably she was into it but whatever, we\\'ll play along. So that was an affront to Odysseus\\' honor. And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything. Because this was a pre-legal society. No laws, no courts, no cops, school\\'s out, f*ck 12. (airhorn blast) So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation. And that\\'s what kept people from stealing and lying and murdering each other. Though it was also often the thing causing them to murder each other. Because back then honor was the only thing protecting people from being taken advantage of. If you\\'re an ancient Mycenaean King and someone invites themselves into your house and drinks your wine and seduces your wife, well, you can\\'t let them get away with that. \\'Cause then people will walk all over you. So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person who is not to be messed with. It\\'s also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures. Hard masculinity is a defensive posture, an intimidating posture. It showcases strength and hides vulnerability. We call it toxic masculinity now because in our society, it\\'s destructive and dysfunctional. We\\'ve moved beyond the need for this, which is why it\\'s possible for me to exist. If society collapses and we go back to Achilles in Odysseus, I\\'m in danger. I\\'m much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery. Back in Homer\\'s time, I\\'d be, well, I\\'d be a slave at Femboy Symposium. Extremely sad gay sounds, nyaa. But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not an option such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands or gangsters who need to resolve conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function. It\\'s a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake. And the poison is vengeance, justice served. So revenge is arguably the most basic form of retributive justice. The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a \"wild justice,\" according to the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge. Research! I am very smart, nyaa. But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons. An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn\\'t you know that? If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is gonna try to get revenge by killing you. It\\'s a cycle, a cycle of smashing. At the end of \"The Odyssey\", the families and the suitors Odysseus killed band together and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus. And literally the last thing that happens in the Odyssey is that the goddess Athena, who has an inexplicable lady boner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him by just making the families forget that Odysseus killed their children. So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence. But in reality, that doesn\\'t happen very much. So these cycles can last for decades or even centuries. In Albania, there\\'s an ancient code called The Kanun which requires a family to commit murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them. Life for life, blood for blood. This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations. And in fact, it still sometimes happens in parts of Northern Albania. There\\'s documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the rest of their lives, because there\\'s a vendetta against them and if they leave the house, they\\'ll be murdered. Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins. These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange for getting to live as men. There\\'s still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society they\\'re socially recognized as men, allowed to wear men\\'s clothes, use a male name uwu, act as head of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges of a man. Extremely happy trans sounds uwu. I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must\\'ve been. Because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to support trans rights. No one wants that so you know it was a last resort. - Um, sworn virgins weren\\'t transgender, most were compelled to provide- - Yeah, I know that sweaty. It was just a joke okay calm down. Revenge cycles also happen on a larger scale between communities, nations, ethnicities, religions. I\\'m worried if I give a real example, I\\'ll be canceled for seeming neutral about a conflict where I\\'m supposed to take a side. So, in the interest of cowardice, let\\'s say that the cat girls bomb the dog girls and then the dog girls bomb the cat girls and that cycle repeats for a few decades. And by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter list of grievances against each other that reconciliation is close to impossible. Extremely angry gay sounds, nyaa. So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system. It\\'s bloody, it\\'s chaotic and it produces these endless cycles of violence. So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos caused by vengeance. And the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal system. Two, retribution. The extremely heckin cute and valid German sociologist Max Weber defined the state as the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long as they do so in accordance with the code of honor. But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people. In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as History Times. The code of Hammurabi looked like this. The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some primitive attempt at writing. I mean, it was like a thousand years ago so I\\'m sure they were doing their best. It\\'s very good, sweetie. I\\'ll hang it up on the refrigerator for you. I was expecting this replica to be bigger, sort of a Spinal Tap \"Stonehenge\" situation. The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall, and they were publicly placed in the city so that everyone knew what the laws were, even though most people were illiterate but, hey, they tried sort of. Let\\'s read some of Hammurabi\\'s laws. That\\'s content, right? Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi, nyaass queen! We don\\'t deserve rights (laughs). So there\\'s 282 laws and they\\'re all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment is Y. Law 22, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death. That\\'s extremely valid. If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother, \"You are not my father or my mother\", his tongue shall be cut off. At least they\\'re standing up for adoptive parents. If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out. Now we\\'re getting into some of the classics. If he break another man\\'s bone, his bone shall be broken. If a freed man strike the body of another freed man, he shall pay 10 shekels in money. But if the slave of a freed man strike the body of a freed man, his ear shall be cut off. Oh, so there\\'s different punishments for different classes. So it\\'s like our legal system, except honest. If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly and the house which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death. If it killed the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death. Love that. Okay, so by modern standards, the code of Hammurabi, it does not pass the vibe check. The vibrations are very negative. It\\'s a lot of cutting people\\'s hands off and burning them alive. Just a major vibe killer all around. But you have to credit Hammurabi\\'s code for resolving the problem of honor-driven revenge cycles. You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against their family and potentially starting a generations long blood feud, you take your grievance to the elders of the city who reach a verdict and impose a sentence, justice served. So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice. Let\\'s list all the differences. Revenge is personal in the sense that it\\'s the victim who does the avenging. It\\'s often emotional, an act of passion. It can be disproportionate, as in Odysseus killing the suitors for squatting in his palace. And it\\'s sadistic, it\\'s satisfying to the avenger. Revenge is sweet. On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal in the sense that the punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim. It\\'s therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion and also lacking the sadism of sweet revenge. It\\'s also proportionate, again, in theory. You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it\\'s an eye for an eye and no more than an eye, and that could be considered humane compared to say, revenge killing someone\\'s family for an eye. And it\\'s also consistent. So different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for the same crime. I mean, unless you\\'re rich, in which case, don\\'t you even worry your little head about it, just pay some gold, it\\'s fine. Girl, these contacts, like- (ominous music) So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice. Which is why it\\'s so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw Punisher. Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal while rejecting revenge as lawless. However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge. It scratches the same emotional itch. It\\'s basically revenge by proxy. If revenge is wild justice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge. In both cases, there\\'s a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of way. Like in the code of Hammurabi, there\\'s this symbolic retaliation of punishing the body part that you offended with, cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the breasts of the wet nurse who switched the babies, cutting out the tongue that renounced its parents. There\\'s a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation the this symmetry of punishment and crime. For a modern example, here\\'s a poetic justice post from r/instantkarma. \"Mugshots.com puts people\\'s mugshots online and then demands payment to take them down. The site\\'s founders were just arrested for extortion. Here are their mugshots.\" There\\'s something metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful cosmic harmony. And my guess is that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct that\\'s difficult to get rid of. But that doesn\\'t mean we shouldn\\'t question it. The logic of retribution has been questioned for thousands of years by philosophers, reformists, messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they\\'re too good to enjoy violence. One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the love and forgiveness school. And the main love and forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have heard of called Jesus of Nazareth. Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were similar to the code of Hammurabi. Like in the book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses including some relaunches of Hammurabi classics. Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to Exodus 21:22. If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely, but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman\\'s husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. Headpats for headpats. Welcome to catgirl Bible study, nyaa. Extremely devotional gay sounds, uwu. I feel very spiritually aroused right now. My third eye chakra? Dripping. Macaroni in a pot. (Macaroni stirring sound) I need Jesus. I\\'m so sorry. So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked. It\\'s basically an eye for an eye, don\\'t be a homo, you know, basic common sense. But then Jesus comes along and he\\'s riding his high horse of love and forgiveness. In Matthew 26:52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays him but Jesus says, \"Put your sword back in its place, Spartacus. All who draw the sword will die by the sword.\" Now, some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced even to the point where you shouldn\\'t defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism. Denying the right of marginalized people to defend themselves? Rethink this. It gets worse. In the sermon on the mount, Jesus says, \"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\" Love your enemies? But I don\\'t wanna love my enemies. No loving, smashing! But maybe, Jesus wasn\\'t as literal-minded as that. You know, religion is a very subjective thing and I have my own Bible interpretations. And my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm. Like, consider Matthew 5:38. Why is no one talking about Matthew 5:38? Jesus says, \"You\\'ve heard that it was said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone\\'s strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.\" Think of the drama of what he\\'s asking you to do here. Someone strikes you across the face and you go, \"Uhhhh.\" This is not pacifism. This is passive aggression, some sort of primeval Hebrew shade. This is the Christianity of, okay, well, I\\'ll pray for you. But if you do take Jesus at face value then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response to wrongdoing, is not justice at all. It\\'s an alternative to justice. In the absence of justice, forgiveness is an emotional unburdening of the resentment and anger that victims of injustice experience. And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about serving earthly justice, because justice is really God\\'s business, and he\\'ll take care of that when the day of judgment comes. It\\'s a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism there\\'s the idea of karma, which is like a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human institution. You reap what you sow basically, so maybe don\\'t worry about injustice too much \\'cause karma will take care of it. This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just world fallacy, the cognitive bias that sees the world as inherently fair and good. \"Everything happens for a reason.\" If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say, \"There\\'s a special place in God\\'s kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.\" And then they\\'ll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being an*lly demolished by fire demons or whatever. People reassure themselves like this because it relieves the stress of enduring unresolved injustice. In the Bible, the book of Job deals with the problem of injustice. Why do bad things happen to good people? And the answer is, just don\\'t worry about it. It\\'s part of God\\'s plan. It\\'ll all work out in the end. It\\'s fine. Everything\\'s fine. The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of very not good. In which case you might start getting ideas in your head about, I don\\'t know, maybe changing some things. I guess I should disclaimer that #NotAllReligion and obviously many political activists have been influenced by faith. But let\\'s put a pin in that for now. Three, utilitarianism. So there\\'s also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking which tries to define justice as something other than retaliation. Utilitarian reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve society rather than punishment for punishment\\'s sake. Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says that the right thing to do is whatever causes the highest ratio of human happiness to human suffering. So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future crimes, where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy. Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence, punishing criminals as an incentive for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons, or rehabilitation of criminals, trying to educate or discipline them so that they can reenter society. A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than retribution, which is very based in emotions. Also the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense even if you don\\'t believe in free will. Cause retribution really only makes sense if you believe that people freely choose their actions and are therefore culpable for their behavior and can be deserving of punishment. Because punishing someone for something they didn\\'t meaningfully choose seems, well... The Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian King Xerxes ordering the sea to be whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge. Which seems irrational, right? To punish a force of nature. Leave my beautiful wet wife alone! It\\'s debatable how free humans are, like we\\'re at least partially products of our genetics, our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venus in our natal chart, dry, oily or combination. And modern criminal sentencing tries to take all of that into consideration. Like you might get a lighter sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never took you to Disneyland, it was a crime of passion. Through no fault of my own, I was high on bath salts at the time of the tax evasion, your honor. A lot of the language around punishment in our legal system is utilitarian. Like, prisons are called \"correctional facilities\" and not \"retribution cages.\" But \"correctional facilities\" is a euphemism because the fact is, these facilities are not doing very much correcting. I\\'m sorry. In the United States, 2/3 of released prisoners are rearrested within three years, and 76% are rearrested within five years. And just think about the way we talk about incarceration. Like if someone really evil gets a long sentence, we say, \"Good, I hope he rots in prison.\" Like when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said, \"Good, the proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and release him a contributing member of his community.\" So even the institutions we have, they are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative function are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish. I think the problem with utilitarianism is that while it\\'s very rational, it\\'s often offensive to human emotions. And you can say facts don\\'t care about your feelings, we shouldn\\'t be basing our legal system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind. And I agree with you, but the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don\\'t wanna rehabilitate him. You wanna set him on fire. And this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion affects law enforcement too. A YouTuber called Jose has a video called \"Why Some Cops Think They\\'re The Punisher,\" which argues that some cops and soldiers admire \"The Punisher\" because they relate to his military background while fantasizing about the moral simplicity of his vigilantism. Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans who say things like, \"Castle doesn\\'t see shades of grey, which, unfortunately, the American justice system is littered with and which tends to slow down and sometimes even hinder victims of crime from getting the justice they deserve. Frank Castle is the ultimate definition of Occam\\'s razor for the military. Don\\'t worry about uniforms, inspections or restrictive rules of engagement. Find the bad guys. Kill the bad guys. Protect the innocent. Any true warrior? That\\'s the dream.\" So these cops and soldiers feel cramped by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice. You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier if it weren\\'t for all these pesky laws. There\\'s a childish simplicity and dualism to this moral worldview. Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys. Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric about how you need a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun. They sound like eight-year-old boys playing Cops and Robbers. \"Good guys and bad guys.\" That\\'s my impression of an eight year old boy. And to be fair, I totally understand the appeal of moral simplicity. People love Justice Served and Instant Karma videos for a reason. We take satisfaction in swift, decisive, elegant retribution. But the procedures of law enforcement and criminal justice don\\'t allow for that. There\\'s all these tedious roadblocks. Right to an attorney, right to remain silent, right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence. A lot of police wish they could simplify things by being judge, jury, and executioner. But the function of police is supposed to be limited to making arrests and initiating criminal investigations. They\\'re not supposed to be walking avatars of karma dispensing free-form retribution in the streets at will, justice served, Now with 20% more police brutality. But a lot of people defend the police when they behave like this because the thin-wristed civilians are just as emotionally frustrated by due process as the cops. Wow did I just say \"All Lives Are Bastards?\" I\\'m double canceled. Well look, all lives are bastards but only some bastards are armed by the state and licensed to go bastarding around town. The rest of us have to be bastards on our off-time. I also think there\\'s a secular version of the just world fallacy going on here. People like to think that if the police kill somebody, it must be because that person did something wrong. Karma at work, justice served. Victim blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy, you get what you deserve so if something bad happens to you, you must have been asking for it. And obviously racism is a huge part of this. You know, there\\'s the structural white supremacy that occupies Black neighborhoods with police instead of investing in communities, and people are prejudiced and more likely to think of Black people as criminal thugs and therefore deserving of police violence. So we get this \"no angel\" discourse that comes up every time a Black person is murdered by the police, where they bring up the victim\\'s criminal record or a picture of them looking like a scary thug, as if that proves they deserved to die. The problem with this, of course, is that no one is an angel. There are no angels walking this earth. We\\'re all flawed, we\\'ve all made mistakes, we\\'ve all done bad things. That doesn\\'t mean we deserve to die a violent death. And then there\\'s people like Breonna Taylor and Elijah McClain who as far as we know were about as close to angels as humans come, but that didn\\'t protect them. Though that is 100% beside the point because Black people in America should not literally have to have white feather wings and glowing halos to deserve not to be murdered by the police. In fact, people of all races have the absolute right to be low life, drug addicted, petty criminals who contribute absolutely nothing to society and yet still not be executed by the cops because that\\'s what it\\'s supposed to mean to live in a free country. So, things need to change. The Punisher police have got to go, and a lot of the rest of our justice system with them. We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice. And to be honest, that might take more than one YouTube video. I know at the beginning I said I was gonna explain what justice is, but... I lied. I\\'m sorry that I can\\'t fix America. I\\'m just a lonely cat. I guess the only solution is... revolution. And by revolution, I do mean vote Democrat and then bully the Democrats into actually doing something. And if they don\\'t listen, well... (phone rings) Hang on, let me get this. Moshi moshi? Heyhowareyou desu! (hiss) ♪ \"Catgirl Army\" by Zoë Blade ♪',\n",
       " 2: ' (light classical music) - Hello again, the gays! Welcome to my garden party fantasy. Straight people are of course welcome to tag along too, provided you\\'re emotionally damaged. Hi! Hey how are you! Cringe! Let\\'s talk about it! The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately. It just pops into my head all the time. Like when I randomly remember that month back in 2013 when all my Facebook posts were just lyrics to Kesha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter? Why? What audience was that for? Who is this inconceivable person I used to be? Cringe! Megacringe! I think I say this word like 50 times a day, cringe cringe cringe. And I\\'m not the only one. Google Trends shows that in the US search interest in the word cringe has dramatically increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since. And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe is at an all-time high the month I\\'m making this video. So what is cringe? Well, let\\'s start with some examples. There was a recent thread on AskReddit titled \"What Things Really Make You Cringe?\" And here\\'s some of the most upvoted responses, \"The time I was talking too loud at a wedding \"when I wasn\\'t supposed to and everyone \"at the wedding turned around to see \"what asshole wouldn\\'t shut up.\" \"Recordings of my own voice.\" \"When I remember that I did the \\'I do have a boyfriend, \\'he just goes to another school\\' thing\" \"Early teen me. \"So many cringe stuff I did. \"I hope all of my old friends have forgotten about me\" \"This happened about two years ago. \"I ordered some Pizza Hut online \"and when it was delivered, \"the lady handed me the pizza boxes. \"I said thanks and she told me my shirt was inside out. \"I said oh, and then she hands me the receipt \"to sign and leave a tip, and I spend 30 seconds \"trying to get the pen to work. \"She looks at the pen and says \\'you have to click the pen.\\' \"I said oh, and then she reaches \"to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good. \"Then I said \\'you too\\' and then I closed the door \"and killed myself.\" All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl says in her book \"Cringeworthy: A Theory of Awkwardness.\" According to Dahl, \"The moments that make us cringe are when we\\'re yanked out \"of our own perspective, and we can suddenly \"see ourselves from somebody else\\'s point of view.\" She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who in the \\'60s did a study of the Biami tribe in New Guinea where he showed them mirror, video, and photographic images of themselves for the first time, and described the results: \"They were paralyzed: after their first startled \"response, covering their mouths and ducking \"their heads, they stood transfixed, \"staring at their images, \"only their stomach muscles betraying great tension.\" So basically, they cringed at themselves. Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing. Like, pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice when they hear a recording for the first time, I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating in your head. So when you hear the recording you realize oh God, that\\'s how other people hear me all the time. And you\\'re suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear to yourself, and the way you appear to other people. That\\'s when you cringe, that feeling Dahl describes as \"The intense visceral reaction produced \"by an awkward moment, an unpleasant kind \"of self-recognition where you suddenly \"see yourself through someone else\\'s eyes. \"It\\'s a forced moment of self-awareness, \"and it usually makes you cognizant \"of the disappointing fact \"that you aren\\'t measuring up to your own self-concept.\" When you\\'re talking too loud at a wedding and suddenly everyone turns around to see what asshole wouldn\\'t shut up, you suddenly realize how you look to them, because we\\'ve all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn\\'t shut up. But this time, you\\'re the asshole. Cringe! Oftentimes, it\\'s the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe. There\\'s no law of state or even of etiquette that tells you exactly how loud to speak at a wedding. It\\'s something you have to intuit based on context: how loud are other people speaking? Is the ceremony about to begin and we\\'re all supposed to be quiet now? According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael Here, the function of awkwardness is that-- - It sands social dynamics by smoothing out even what etiquette doesn\\'t rule on. - Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward. It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego. And memories of your cringey moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves. 10 years later you\\'ll be trying to fall asleep and for no reason at all your brain will decide to remind you of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding, and of the stupid thing you were saying when everyone turned around, and you\\'ll cringe all over again. That\\'s why remembering your teenage years is so painful, \\'cause you look back and you realize, damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years. Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don\\'t know, November? All the examples we\\'ve considered so far involve self-cringe, but usually when we talk about cringe on the Internet, we\\'re talking about cringing at other people. Popular subreddits like r/cringe, cringepics, and Cringetopia host videos and images of people behaving in cringey ways, for instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis, grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry, and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter with black people. - Who let the dogs out? Who, who? - Ugh watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire. It makes me wanna crawl out of my body and escape into another dimension. I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others. For me it\\'s uncomfortable to the point where I\\'ll reflexively pause a video like that because I just can\\'t stand it. In other words, it\\'s like watching my own YouTube videos, which sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room. So why is it that cringing at other people hurts the same way as cringing at yourself? Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment, or second-hand embarrassment. Basically, it\\'s a form of empathy. When you cringe at someone, you\\'re feeling the embarrassment that they\\'re feeling, just as if you see someone fall down the stairs you might wince empathetically with their pain. But there\\'s a problem with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe, or at least a complication. Which is that in the purest examples of cringe, the person doing the cringey thing isn\\'t feeling embarrassed. In fact, often they\\'re super confident, and it\\'s actually their lack of self-awareness about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe. Like when a woman posts a ridiculously over-Facetuned picture of herself as if anyone\\'s going to believe she looks like that, or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus. So in the Internet sense of the word, cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment. Someone tripping and falling onstage is embarrassing, and I do feel embarrassed for her. But she knows it\\'s embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed. - You guys are just standing up \\'cause I fell and that\\'s really embarrassing but thank you. - Nothing about this is cringe. Maybe to her, it\\'s self-cringe. Maybe she looks back on it and it\\'s still embarrassing. But I don\\'t cringe at her. Maybe there\\'s a difference between cringing at someone and cringing with them. When someone falls on stage I cringe with her, in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment; my feelings mirror what she\\'s feeling. But when I\\'m cringing at someone, I\\'m feeling something very different to what they\\'re feeling. I\\'m cringing at Captain Badass over here because he doesn\\'t have the decency to cringe at himself. Another example is bad American Idol auditions, which are quintessential cringe content. People try out for American Idol because they think they\\'re good enough singers to compete in a national competition. So they\\'re effectively revealing their own delusions when they show up and sing like this. ♪ Is this the real life ♪ ♪ Or is this just fantasy ♪ - It\\'s not just that he\\'s terrible that makes it cringe. Most of us are bad singers, right, when people sing Happy Birthday at a party, usually they\\'re singing in three different keys at no particular tempo. But that\\'s not cringe because the point of singing Happy Birthday is not to sound amazing. Bad American Idol auditions are cringe because of the contestants\\' misplaced confidence. - Who are you as good as in your opinion? - The lead singer from Queen. - It\\'s the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog. (singing out of tune) I admit that watching Red, I\\'m actually not in very much pain when I\\'m cringing at him. I laugh at his ludicrous performance, just like the judges do. And, because he\\'s so cocky, and because he doesn\\'t show signs of embarrassment himself, there\\'s a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure. There\\'s almost a sense of karma, a sense that because of his tragic hubris, he deserves the humiliation he\\'s bringing upon himself. And my sense that he deserves it suppresses my compassionate response, and it helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have about taking pleasure in someone\\'s humiliation. Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant, Meesha, who\\'s there with her mom, and they both seem like such sweethearts. - I do believe in her talent very much. - And yeah she\\'s delusional about her singing talent, but I\\'m routing for her, and when she embarrasses herself I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe. ♪ Don\\'t you wish your girlfriend was hot like me ♪ - Yikes. My differing reactions to Red and Meesha track a distinction that Dahl makes between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe. Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification with the person you\\'re cringing at. Even if they aren\\'t actually embarrassed themselves in the cringeworthy moment, you still feel the embarrassment they would feel or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware of how other people are perceiving them. Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand, involves an emotional distancing from the person you\\'re cringing at. Just like with compassionate cringe, you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves, but instead of feeling that embarrassment on their behalf, you feel annoyance and disgust at them, and maybe even a little schadenfreude. So these are actually two very different emotional responses, vicarious embarrassment versus contempt. But we call both feelings cringe, not because they\\'re similar feelings, but because they\\'re responses to the same type of situation: people lacking self-awareness embarrassing themselves without realizing it. Now, embarrassment and contempt, seem, at face value, like pretty unpleasant feelings. So why are we so fascinated by content that makes us feel that way? Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members? Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos so popular on YouTube? Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations? Well I think the answer to that question depends on whether we\\'re cringing compassionately or contemptuously. When I read that AskReddit thread, where all the people share their cringe stories, I cringe compassionately, that is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them. And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with them. I recognize myself in them, and I\\'m reassured to hear that other people are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am. I\\'m not the only one who cringes at my past, or at videos of myself; I\\'m not the only who\\'s says \"You too\", when the person says the pizza smells good. When we collectively laugh at these situations, we\\'re bonding over our shared human frailty. We\\'re recognizing that we all say the wrong thing sometimes. That we\\'ve all arrogantly argued for an opinion, only to later educate ourselves and realize how ignorant and wrong we were. That we\\'ve all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable, as beautiful, and talented, and badass; only to totally miss the mark and completely embarrass ourselves. And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses; it makes us feel less alone. Now, this is all of course assuming that we\\'re cringing compassionately. But I would argue that most cringe content on the Internet does not encourage compassion. And that\\'s kind of an uncomfortable fact, because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved. This is the 21st century, right? Pillories and freakshows and public floggings, these are barbaric practices from the Dark Ages, right? Surely no one the Internet would ever entertain themselves by humiliating people, right? (frantic circus music) We\\'ve got maniacs, we\\'ve got wackadoos, we\\'ve got schizos, fatties, and spergs! Come see sexual deviants on display! That\\'s right folks, we\\'ve got cackling perverts of every denomination! Come see the panty-sniffer, he\\'ll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings! Come see the skeleton girl, she hasn\\'t had a bite in 30 days! That\\'s right we\\'ve got real live lesbians! I\\'ll be your master of ceremonies: half man, half woman, all freak. Okay, we\\'ve heard enough heartwarming gibberish, welcome to the dark side of cringe. Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture. And by that I mean there\\'s whole channels making content that centers the experience of cringing, and there\\'s a huge audience that seeks out cringe content, which includes content the creator doesn\\'t intend to be cringe. I first started paying attention to this back in 2016, which was the heyday of the feminist cringe compilation or the SJW cringe compilation. Remember those? This is all ancient history by YouTube standards but in 2106, the word cringe was most associated with a teenage YouTuber called LeafyIsHere. His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video, which means he would play someone else\\'s content, then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is. ♪ No makeup with some sweatpants ♪ - [Man] Oh my God. It\\'s so f*cking bad. He looks like he\\'s genderfluid. He looks like a f*cking lesbian. - This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential, and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts and freethinking tuxedos. - [Man] What even is this thing? It must be one of the 76 genders. I didn\\'t realize retarded was a gender. - I\\'m sorry my dudes, you were on the cringe side of history. Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos. The logical antelope isn\\'t inviting you to foster a shared sense of humanity by recognizing your own weakness in the embarrassment of screeching feminists. No. This is an invitation to contempt. Here\\'s a YouTube video titled \"Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.\" You\\'d expect from the title that it would be a video of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways. But it isn\\'t. It\\'s literally just a compilation of fat people doing things. This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming. Is this cringe? What is cringe about it? Earlier we defined cringe as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt for someone who lacks self-awareness about the way others are perceiving them. But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there\\'s no context, so we don\\'t know anything about her mental state. And we certainly don\\'t know whether she\\'s self-aware about how she\\'s being perceived. If there was an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel, or if she tried to Photoshop herself to look like a size four, okay, maybe that would be cringe. But that\\'s not what\\'s going on in this clip. She\\'s just existing, in water. What cringe are we being invited to feel over this? Presumably, something along the lines of \"Ew, fat people. \"Gross.\" It\\'s literally just disgust, right? Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body. Here\\'s another cringe compilation, this one titled \"Genderfluid Non-Binary Cringe\" and we\\'re watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their genderfluid identity - Honestly it\\'s kind of terrifying because genderfluid people just aren\\'t as accepted. - Yeah apparently not. And judging from the fact that I\\'m currently watching this in a cringe compilation, it seems the person in the video was dead on about how other people will perceive them. But despite that self-awareness, we\\'re being invited to cringe. Because I guess being genderfluid, like being fat, is cringe in and of itself. Now, the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe. This isn\\'t real cringe, I want to say, cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others. But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread that there\\'s really no point in objecting to it. If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia, one of the sleazier cringe subreddits, you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow, a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper. These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts. They\\'re types of people who are widely ridiculed online. I\\'d like to share with you a list that I\\'ve put together of groups that are often considered to be cringe, Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels, neckbeards, fedora-tippers, gamers, TikTok teens, not-like-other-girls girls, fanfic writers, beat poets, SJWs, feminists, MAGAs, trans people, non-binary people, transtrenders, queer AFAB ukulele players, autistic people, fat people, the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled. Now I\\'m searching for some thread that all these groups have in common. And a handful of themes do jump out: Deviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual. A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism. The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure. Obsessive interests in unconventional hobbies. Low social status. It\\'s pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days. If you add up all the groups on this list, I bet it includes most of the people watching this video. It includes me three or four times. I\\'m, of course, a fedora-tipping, queer, AFAB ukulele-playing, TikTok teen. Can\\'t we just accept that we\\'re all a bit cringe and try to be like compassionate or whatever? (scoffing) F*ck no. The Internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullsh*t. Oh no, this is social reject \"Battle Royale.\" Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way, and I want to explore what the rewards might be. Let\\'s start by looking at the role of cringe in Internet politics, where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy. At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so, you couldn\\'t escape clips of this woman known as Big Red, a Toronto resident who showed up at a Men\\'s Rights event and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely. - It\\'s part of patriarchy. Part of patriarchy. I don\\'t know if you\\'re noticing a theme: Patriarchy. I\\'m reading, f*ckface. Mr. Entitled. Mr. Ego. Patriarchy f*ckface! - She\\'s one of these people who generates memeable phrases at an amazing rate. I actually think she\\'s hilarious and iconic, but, I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia. Anyway this video appeared in countless cringe compilations, reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays. Often Big Red was framed as like THE feminist, the mascot of feminism, a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists. Which is highly dishonest, considering she\\'s not even a high-profile activist or thinker. She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto. But because of this amusing 12-minute video, it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman, who, we we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form. I call this strategy mascotization, the construction of a strawman nemesis. What you do is you select a cringeworthy person and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team. It\\'s very simple, but very effective. And it\\'s best paired with memeification; that\\'s when you take a single moment in a person\\'s life, you freeze it, and you declare that that moment fully represents a person. Then, through mascotization, you declare that this memeified person represents an entire group or movement. Other right-wing memes from this era include this protestor. - You\\'re a f*cking white male. - Memeified as AIDS Skrillex. And this protestor. - Get your hate speech off this campus. Get your hate speech off this campus. - Who was memeified as Trigglypuff. The two of them symbolized the wretchedness of beta numale cuckoldry, and the hysteria of social justice crybullies, respectively. I guess the ultimate memeified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian, about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded. Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe, as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb-tier casual throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers. Other times it was almost a super-villainous caricature, this sort of dark devouring mother archetype, threatening to confiscate your video games and engulf you in her yonic abyss. Now it\\'s obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as supervillains is effective. Though it comes at the risk of backfiring by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful, a little too bad-ass. But the subtler strategy of symbolizing your political enemies with not an evil but a cringeworthy mascot works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense emotional way. Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule and if someone has been made a laughing stock, it\\'s much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing than it is to risk being laughed at yourself. To be cringe is to not be in on the joke. And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection, I think one reason we\\'re fascinated by cringe content is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at. When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online, laughing at someone and ridiculing them, we register an emotional memory of it as a warning: don\\'t act like that, or people will laugh at you. This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior. It\\'s why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals. You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory, at the whipping post; you see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables. And it sends a powerful message. Don\\'t do what that guy did. I don\\'t think the Internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it\\'s the 17th Century. There\\'s no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks, but instead, there\\'s teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos; there\\'s ex-boyfriends revenge-posting their girlfriend\\'s nudes; there\\'s vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone for alleged breaches of wokeness. Public humiliation is a powerful force, and it\\'s usually uh, it\\'s not a good force. But there are some rare exceptions. Back in the Gamergate era-Gamegate itself of course being a study in public humiliation, slut-shaming on a massive online scale- YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism. As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks, and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers who were constantly mobbed and harassed. What I see as one of the turning points in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days to the LeftTube world of today was a handful of videos uploaded by the then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis, in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual called Davis Aurini. - Come on Davis, no stop lecturing me about ethics we have to get out of here, and can you please stop trying to start a forest fire! - [Natalie] In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women, while posing in front a toy skull and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey. - Men of the West, women in our culture have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome. And so in discussing sluts versus whores, I would start with the premise that all women are whores. - Harry\\'s videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views and a fairly positive response even from a mostly male gamer audience, who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time. Why did these videos work with this audience, where so many others didn\\'t? Well, I think it\\'s because Harry didn\\'t moralistically call out Davis for being problematic or misogynistic. Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact that Davis is a cringeworthy buffoon. And Davis was a perfect target because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense; he had no self-awareness about the fact that pretty much everyone saw through his absurd posturing as a badass tough guy by day, profoundly dark philosopher by night. - We exist in a world with feminized legislation. - I\\'ve spoken to men and boys, who\\'ve told me that Harry\\'s videos inspired the beginnings of a feminist awakening in them, not just because they cringed at Davis Aurini, but also because they recognized a little bit of Davis in themselves, and they cringed at that too. Recognizing part of yourself in a cringeworthy person induces self-cringe, which can motivate you to change your behavior, your beliefs, or even your own self-concept. And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance of a recognizable stock character on the Internet, namely the fedora-tipper. Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader for traditional masculinity, but who\\'s basically just a pasty nerd who can\\'t relate to women. Davis was such an extreme version of this, and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments so frequently that I would classify him as what the Internet calls a lolcow. Lolcow is old 4chan lingo, it means a person whose unintentionally eccentric or foolish behavior can be milked for lols. Milking in this context can mean simply watching the lolcow\\'s behavior and laughing at them, or it can mean making reaction videos where you make fun of them, or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them to get a response that you find entertaining. I\\'d describe Harry\\'s videos about Davis, or my old videos about The Golden One as lolcow-milking content, with a political angle. It was essentially an argument from ridicule, an argument from cringe, with the aim of convincing people: don\\'t embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs. But also, and I\\'ll just speak for myself here, I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer. And I wanted people to laugh. There doesn\\'t need to be a political agenda behind milking lolcows, in fact usually there isn\\'t. The purest example of a lolcow I can think of is actually someone from way before the Internet, namely Florence Foster Jenkins. Jenkins, or Lady Florence as she liked to be called, was an American soprano who attracted a cult following in New York City during the 1920s, \\'30s and \\'40s due to her being such a terrible singer that people went to her concerts essentially for the lols. She was described as \"The world\\'s worst opera singer. \"No one, before or since, \"has succeeded in liberating themselves quite \"so completely from the shackles of musical notation.\" Behold this f*cking camp queen. Oh we have no choice but to stan. Here\\'s a short clip of one of the few recordings she made. (bird squawking) Cringe. So she was essentially the Tommy Wiseau, the William Hung of her age. Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence, until 1944, when she was 76 years old, and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert, to which newspaper critics showed up. The next morning, the New York Sun reported, \"Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking \"in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note \"was from its proper elevation the more \"the audience laughed and applauded.\" And five days later she had heart attack and died. I find something very touching about this story. I mean I\\'d probably be laughing as much as anyone if I were at Carnegie Hall that night, but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence. It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell; at least he tries to stop these people before things get out of hand. I think it\\'s normal to have mixed feelings about a lolcow. Like yes this is hilarious but on the other hand, doth not a lolcow bleed? On some level we know it\\'s wrong to entertain ourselves this way, but on the other hand, other people\\'s pain is incredibly entertaining. There\\'s a good book about this called \"The Joy of Pain: Schadenfreude and the Dark Side \"of Human Nature by Richard Smith.\" Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take in other people\\'s misery, and Smith argues that we experience it because psychologically we gain something when other people lose. We\\'re constantly evaluating our own worth by comparing ourselves to other people. So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost, a pleasant feeling of superiority from comparing ourselves to people beneath us, especially if we\\'re kind of insecure to begin with. Maybe I\\'m not perfect, but at least I\\'m not this lolcow. And we also get a boost when people who are socially above us, whom we envy, get brought down a peg. James Charles is canceled party, lolol. I think schadenfreude basically accounts for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com. Smith uses the word humilitainment for this type of media, like reality TV shows designed to produce spectacular moments of embarrassment. YouTube is basically a big reality TV show, or some kind of a carnival sideshow. I mean, take a look around you. We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who at the time I\\'m making this video remains apparently in total denial about her eating disorder, and continues to make videos modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers. We have WingsOfRedemption, a bad-tempered gamer who for a long time was essentially confined by poverty, obesity, and depression to streaming video games all day to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him. We have Onision, a habitual, alleged, abuser of women and teenage girls who earlier this year essentially performed his own mental breakdown on YouTube after Patreon banned him for doxxing an accuser. - I love kombucha. Whooo, whooo! - Whose idea was it to give hundreds of pathological narcissists access to video equipment? What kind of sick social experiment are we living in? And the viewers are no better than the performers. Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick. Oh, you people love nothing more than to watch one of us poor helpless egomaniacs completely lose our minds live on camera. - Is this what you want, huh? Is this what, you want a total meltdown! - You know as a creator you have to be aware that you\\'re a circus performer, and the crowd may in fact be more entertained if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers. Online media today is full of Lady Florences, anti-celebrities with anti-fans. Now, to be clear, I don\\'t think there\\'s anything inherently wrong with indulging now and then in a little bit of light contempt. Cringing at Davis Aurini or bad American Idol auditions seems pretty harmless, but it can be taken too far. And there\\'s no better case study of taking it too far than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler. If you don\\'t know what\\'s coming, you might wanna strap in gorg, cause this is coconuts, it\\'s bananas, it\\'s a full fruit salad. God how do I even begin to explain this? Well, Christine Weston Chandler, more commonly known on the Internet as Chris-Chan, is the victim of what is quite possibly the longest running and most obsessive Internet trolling saga of all time. She\\'s the lolcow of lolcows. - Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler. coming to you live from home once again. - Chandler is an autistic trans woman, and yes I will be calling her by she/her pronouns, which I pause to explain because I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen anyone actually take her transition seriously. Most people seem to regard it as simply another absurd symptom of her hilarious mental condition. In fact a bunch of trans people will probably get real salty with me for making trans people look bad by including Chris-Chan in our, oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club. Oh please. Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty; this is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society. God, how did tr@nnies get so snobbish? Look is Chris-Chan really trans? I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t care. If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman, I for one support her journey. But it doesn\\'t matter. The relevant thing about Chris-Chan is not Chris-Chan. It\\'s the fact that for the last 13 years, nearly every aspect of her life has been obsessively archived online by thousands of voyeurs known as Christorians. Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom several Internet centuries ago, back in 2007, when 4chan took notice of her comic-book series Sonichu, a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu. The comic is set in CWCville, CWC being Chris-Chan\\'s initials. The protagonist is a self-insert who references Chandler\\'s real-life quote \"Love Quest\" to find a quote, \"Boyfriend-free girl,\" which apparently involved posting bizarre \"attraction signs\" around her community college. For this story to make sense you have to keep in mind that Chandler identified and presented as male until 2015, so these trolls saw her as like the ultimate autistic incel manchild. Just to give you a feel for this person, here is Christine in 2018 holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait, note the Sonichu medallions, here is the bedroom she lived in, and here she is in recent years giving us a full bronycon eleganza. Pegasister snapped. Basically she\\'s the entire Cringetopia subreddit condensed into a single person. So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit, because of course they did, and they began tormenting her by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu, posting candid photos of her, et cetera. Chandler reacted to the trolls, which of course encouraged them more, and the harassment escalated and escalated. They hacked her accounts, or tricked her into giving out passwords, they posted all her emails online. They showed up in person and photographed her house. They called her parents posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers in order to extract as much information about her as possible. And of course they contacted Chandler herself, which was very rewarding for trolls, because she has no filter, and was very naive and trusting. So she was very willing to divulge, or was easily manipulated into divulging, mortifying information about herself, sexual, psychological, scatological, there\\'s not really any limits or boundaries to this. For all the information they gathered, the trolls created a Wiki, called the CWCki, devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris-Chan data. It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom, entire articles about all members of her immediate and extended family, pages of psychiatric records she was tricked into sending them, and that\\'s only the beginning. In their more grandiose moods, the Christorians have speculated that Chris-Chan is the most documented life in all human history, comparing their social experitainment to \"The Truman Show.\" It\\'s a level of obsession that surpasses the wildest excesses of stan culture. It is a gaze into the abyss that does not blink. Some trolls have also sent taunting letters and packages, or on one occasion sex workers to the Chandler household. Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates with Chris-Chan, of course secretly wearing wires to record their conversations. Others pretended to be her Internet girlfriends so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos. These things must be archived don\\'t you understand? Chris-Chan must be documented. The absolute low point came when some trolls encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl and have phone sex with Chris-Chan and record it. In other words, they groomed a child to deceive an autistic person into performing sex acts for their entertainment. Now to contemporary Christorians this sort of sadistic interference with Christine\\'s life is frowned upon, not so much because it\\'s immoral so much as because it\\'s considered a bit tacky, a bit attention seeking. No, to the sophisticated Christorian the real pleasure of all this is supposed to lie in quietly spectating, savoring the fine notes of cringe. Now I take it I don\\'t even need to comment on the morality of all this. The real question to me is why. Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession with Christine Chandler? And yes it is an obsession. Just to give a sense of a single individual\\'s personal investment in this, the YouTuber Geno Samuel, one of very few Christorians with the audacity to show his face, has been working for more than two years to produce an eventual-100-episode documentary series about the life of Chris-Chan. Geno has completed 36 episodes so far, and each episode is around 40 minutes long, meaning he\\'s already produced around 24 hours of video about the life of what is essentially a random stranger. I think this phenomenon deserves its own name. I\\'ll call it morbid cringe: defined as an obsessive and addictive contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group. Why does morbid cringe happen? Well, I\\'ve spent some time poring over Christorians\\' conversations with each other, and I\\'ve even interrogated a couple of them, and this is what I\\'ve found. The first thing they\\'ll tell you is they just think it\\'s funny and entertaining, that Christine\\'s strange life and mind simply appeals to their morbid curiosity. And I\\'m sure that\\'s true. But a lot of things are funny and entertaining and morbidly interesting. Why fixate on this particular person? Well, for a lot of them it\\'s a reassurance that there\\'s someone out there worse than them. Maybe they\\'re nerdy loners with no social skills, but at least this defenseless punching bag called Chris-Chan is here for them to assert their superiority over. It\\'s pretty much common knowledge that a lot of Christorians, including some of the most vocal haters, are autistic themselves. And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris-Chan is that she\\'s, \"Giving autistics a bad name.\" In recent years there\\'s also been a small contingent of transgender trolls, who are likewise prone to say, \"He\\'s not a real transgender like me \"and he\\'s making us all look bad.\" Oh, yeah, because people who troll Chris-Chan, you guys look amazing. It\\'s common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this about why trolling Chandler is justified, righteous even. Because at the end of the day, trolls are people too, and a lot of them actually do have a guilty conscience about this, which they suppress by insisting that Chris-Chan is a horrible person who deserves to be tormented. But trolls who protest-too-much about the evils of Chris-Chan, and therefore reveal the excess of their emotional investment in this, are known in the community as A-Logs. A-Log was a troll who attracted the ire of other trolls by ranting about about Chris-Chan\\'s crimes, comparing her to Hitler, and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession. Among the trolls this kind of behavior is considered an embarrassment to all of them, because they want to feel like they\\'re just coolly and casually toying with this person; you know, just for laughs, not a big deal, this is all perfectly healthy and normal and fine. It\\'s fine. But A-Log gave the lie to that illusion, because it was obvious that his Chris-Chan obsession wasn\\'t healthy or normal or fine. So the other trolls turned on A-Log and they made him into Chris-Chan 2.0, and they uncovered his autism and his furry porn collection and his cringey erotic fanfiction. So why would someone as similar to Chris-Chan as A-Log obsessively hate on her? Well there\\'s two explanations. One is trollshielding, that is A-Log may have performatively despised Chris-Chan and spearheaded the trolling efforts in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls. The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob by waving your pitchfork the hardest. Obviously this did not work. The other other explanation is that A-Log saw himself reflected in Chris-Chan, and sort of projected his own shame and self-contempt onto her. A-Log hated Chris-Chan because he saw part of himself in her. And the other trolls hated A-Log because they saw part of themselves in him. To quote Margaret Pless, who covered this story in New York Magazine a few years ago, \"I think it might be A-Logs all the way down.\" People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-Chan because to them she\\'s a symbol of something they hate about themselves; something they\\'re ashamed of. Maybe it\\'s being on the autism spectrum, or being a socially awkward recluse, maybe it\\'s being unemployed and living with their parents, or an adulthood fixation on children\\'s cartoons, or embarrassing sexual proclivities. Or all of the above. This is how scapegoating works, right, you repress your uncomfortable feelings of shame and insecurity and self-loathing, and you displace them onto someone else, usually someone you can feel superior to. Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat, transforming your painful shame and self-loathing into pleasant judgmental self-righteousness. It\\'s pretty safe to assume that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris-Chan. So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris-Chan is a way of processing the shame and anxiety of social rejection and exclusion. And I think for a lot of people, even normal people who aren\\'t part of a bizarre Internet stalker community, contemptuous cringing helps us cope with our own shame and insecurity. Anyway it\\'s time to stop this tedious empathizing with other people and find a way to make this all about me. (light orchestral music) (music box playing \"Danse Macabre\") (shushing) Meow meow. Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend? Would you like to meet my boyfriend\\'s boyfriend? That\\'s right, henny, I\\'m giving you fujoshi realness nyaa. He\\'s gonna stay right here as a grim reminder of the things that you have seen. Actually, I identify as a trap. It\\'s very that. I guess it\\'s not really cringe if I\\'m trying to be cringe. Cringe is failed seriousness. In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am of being a transgender lesbian. Cringe. Shame! At the end of that video I talk about how I sense that my shame is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel for a lot of other trans lesbians, particularly those of the heckin stripey-sock nya nya catgirl variety. But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians. I want to return to that thought, and kind of psychoanalyze myself as a kind of first-person case study of a morbid cringe obsession. So, catgirl trans girls are, I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to explain this. They\\'re trans women, usually attracted to women, who express their identity online through cloying, neotenous otaku memery. And my conscious reason for cringing at them is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls as a kind of visual baby-talk, an infantilized and unrealistic representation of femininity and womanhood that\\'s designed to titillate nerdy boys. So when trans women identify with it, I cringe. Like, no, you can\\'t become an anime girl, Lily. F*ck your dreams. Now look, I don\\'t want to get sidetracked with a discussion of whether my opinions about catgirls are fair or correct. So don\\'t listen to what I\\'m saying about catgirls. Listen to what I\\'m feeling about catgirls. Listen to the contempt beneath my words. Because even if everything I\\'m saying is true, \"Catgirls are being cringe online\" is a situation so inconsequential, that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much. So why do I have this cringe fixation? Well according to the A-Log Theory of Morbid Cringing, we form obsessive and addictive contempt for people who have traits in common with us; people who make us uncomfortable because we see something of ourselves in them. So do I have traits in common with the catgirls? Well, we\\'re both trans women. We\\'re both attracted to women. Um, I do like anime, but, I don\\'t like the anime they like, okay? I like good anime that has mature, three-dimensional female characters, look I\\'m a real transgender okay I\\'m not like you! It\\'s not lost on me that this is like the seventh time on this channel, I\\'ve dressed as a catgirl, \"to make fun of them.\" (scoffing) I have posted cringe, and you should all be laughing at me right now. Nyanyanyanyanyanya! So I do think there\\'s some truth to the idea that I\\'m A-Logging these catgirls. I also think there\\'s a group representation aspect to this, like I\\'m afraid that other people will cringe at a group that includes me, trans lesbians, because of how these catgirls are acting. So, let\\'s make yet another distinction between ingroup cringe and outgroup cringe. Ingroup cringe is when you cringe at someone who belongs to the same group identity as you, for example your family, your romantic partnership, your ethnicity, or your country. Particularly if they\\'re embarrassing themselves in front of outsiders to the group. Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends. Or, think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump being our president. Or, think about the phrases, \"She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber\", \"They\\'re making trans people look bad\", \"He\\'s giving autistics a bad name.\" When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group, we don\\'t just feel vicarious embarrassment, we feel embarrassment, because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too. So ingroup cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe, because you\\'re cringing at your membership in an embarrassing group. Nothing has ever triggered this kind of ingroup embarrassment more for me than a cringe video that went viral last year in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum over being misgendered in a GameStop. - [Woman] You\\'re gonna give me my f*cking money back. - [Woman] Excuse me, sir, there\\'s a young man here. You need to watch your mouth. - Excuse me, it\\'s ma\\'am. It is ma\\'am. - This video is excruciating for me to watch. - Motherf*cker, take it outside. If you wanna call me sir again, I will show you a f*cking sir. - [Man] I apologize. - [Woman] Motherf*cker. - [Man] I apologize, ma\\'am. (grunting) - The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly intimidate people into seeing you as a woman. (grunting) Now Twitter\\'s gonna come for me over this and say \"Natalie hates trans women who don\\'t pass.\" But passing is really not what this is about. It\\'s aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior from a trans woman, accompanied by apparently total delusion about how she\\'s presenting. - Well I\\'m gonna ask you for the fifth time to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I am not. - It\\'s really not that clear, gorg. And that\\'s what makes this video classic cringe, right, the incongruity between her thinking that she\\'s serving woman while bellowing like a drill sergeant. By the way, what I\\'m doing right now, this is cringe reaction content. I don\\'t really do that on this channel, but I\\'m dipping my toe in just to see how it feels. And it feels good. Like, intoxicatingly good. I can see how you could get addicted to this. I\\'m imagining myself right now surrounded by cis people and I\\'m leading the righteous mob as we all point and laugh at some delusional manly dump truck. I am a real transgender, a true transgender, a good transgender, father finally approves of me! Uh, this would be the unconscious archetypal father. Jot that down in my progress notes please, Doctor. Okay so why does this feel so good? Well, let me talk you through my feelings. When I watch that GameStop video, for first few seconds, I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her. I can even relate, because in the first couple months of my transition, there was an occasion where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction where the guy at the desk was calling me sir the entire time. And there\\'s something very humiliating about trying to present female, like wearing a dress and makeup, and yet being called sir. It\\'s a quintessential mismatch between self-concept and the way other people are seeing you. And the memory of it is painful to me, but what I cling to is that while I may have looked like man, at least I didn\\'t act like a man. I didn\\'t threaten to take anyone outside and \"Show them a sir.\" In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy. So as the GameStop video progresses, my sympathy runs out fast. And instead of compassionate cringe, I feel group embarrassment for trans women including myself, and I feel contempt towards this individual for making us all look bad. I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear: what if I\\'m as delusional as this trans woman? I don\\'t look and sound like that, do I? I feel like I have to do a sanity check. I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror, listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure. That fear motivates me to distance myself from the person in the video. I don\\'t feel compassion for her because that would mean putting myself in her size 16 shoes. And I don\\'t want to do that because I\\'m horrified and repulsed by the thought that I\\'m like her in some way. So I want to push away, and contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself. And if I express that contempt by publicly shaming and condemning her, then I\\'m also socially distancing myself. Accidental Covid jokes. Oops, guess it\\'s uh, contagious. (crowd booing) I think many people who are stigmatized, or who have been humiliated, long for the experience of being a normal, surrounded by fellow normals, judging and humiliating a freak. And if you take a look around trans YouTube, a lot of the biggest creators on the platform have channels that are basically devoted to exactly this type of cringe-reaction humilitainment. The YouTuber Kalvin Garrah is a trans guy who is best known for what are essentially cringe reaction videos, mostly aimed at people he deems transtrenders. That is, people who claim to be trans but who aren\\'t real transgenders like Kalvin. He\\'s especially bothered by girly AFAB trans and non-binary teenagers, or by anyone who muddies the line between trans-masculine and lesbian identities. Sometimes he\\'ll do a long form reaction to a specific person who grinds his gears. - So this person is an asexual, non-binary, transgender lesbian, who uses he/they/its/thons pronouns. According to my calculation, you are a transtrender. - [Natalie] And other times he\\'ll basically just laugh at cringey trans TikTok teens. (laughing) - No, no, I\\'m turning off the video. I can\\'t watch this. - He has a couple justifications for making these videos. One is that he\\'s actually helping the people he\\'s cringing at, because if a trender transitions, then they\\'ll give themselves dysphoria and they\\'ll have to detransition. But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people really help them figure out whether they\\'re trans or not? His other justification is that transtrenders are giving real trans people a bad name; they\\'re the reason people are transphobic, this is why they hates us. It\\'s because of the trenders. Wow, I love the idea of a truscum furry. Isn\\'t that just, isn\\'t that just wonderful? A truscum furry! But it\\'s not though. Transphobia existed long before there were people you could plausibly describe as transtrenders. So transtrenders are not the reason society hates trans people, Kalvin. They\\'re the reason you hate trans people, right? Or at least the trans community. And I feel like what you\\'re doing is you\\'re projecting that feeling onto society at large and saying oh this is the reason people are transphobic. And to be fair I get that it\\'s not just a projection. Back in 2016, the SJW cringe era, it was cis people mocking trans people with all these tropes: attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders, special snowflakes. But now they\\'re used by trans people trying to distance themselves, trying to ghettoize the most laughed at people in the community under the label of transtrenders. And Kalvin there may be some truth to what you\\'re saying about there being confused teenagers who think they\\'re trans when they\\'re not; I mean I wouldn\\'t know cause I\\'m a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life. I don\\'t hang out with teenagers, But if even it is true, Kalvin, your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me. Like, you return to this topic to cringe again and again and again and again and again, it\\'s like you\\'re picking at a wound. It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession, and I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you. This could be me projecting of course but, I wonder if the way you feel about girly sparklegender AFABs is similar to the way I feel about otaku transbian catgirls. And it might be worth considering that I don\\'t cringe at the sparklegenders the way you do. I mean I\\'m with on you on wondering what a he/they/xir genderflux lesbian demiboy is, but unlike you, Kalvin, I just don\\'t have a morbid cringe obsession with feminine AFAB trans people. They can identify as however many genders they want for all I care. I may not always understand it, but I support their journey. I guess it doesn\\'t bother me because I\\'m not worried that anyone will judge me because of how they behave. I don\\'t feel ingroup cringe. Now, it\\'s a different story if I\\'m reading a general lesbian subreddit and I see a comment like: \"Pre-transition trans lesbian here. \"I wish I had titties. \"Girldick nya nya!\" Get the f*ck out of here, Lily! You\\'re giving real trans lesbians a bad name! This is why they hate us! See now I have strong feelings. Now I\\'m ingroup cringing. And intellectually, I do think think my feelings are correct to some extent. Like I don\\'t think a general lesbian community is the appropriate forum for a trans woman who\\'s effectively still living as a man to take the mic and whine about wanting titties or rhapsodize about girldick. But I\\'m also aware that I feel this strongly about this because of my own dysphoria, and my own shame, and, honestly, my self-loathing. Like, I can\\'t even talk to cis women on dating apps, because I feel like a fake woman imposing myself on real women. That\\'s where my head is at. So, where does this pre-transition trans lesbian get the audacity! You know it makes me feel ingroup cringe about an identity, trans lesbianism, which for me is already a pain point of insecurity, embarrassment, and shame. So Kalvin maybe, and again I could just be projecting, but maybe that\\'s kind of like how you feel about these trenders. When you make videos condemning them as not really trans, aren\\'t you essentially exiling them from the ingroup, so that you no longer feel the pain of ingroup cringe? Or perhaps, Kalvin Garrah, what you\\'re really trying to destroy is the trender within. (bell ringing) And again I could be full of sh!t here. At the end of the day this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven\\'t met. So feel free to tell me if I\\'m full of sh!t Kalvin, but still, I guess I invite you to consider whether producing transtrender humilitainment is actually helping anything, or whether it\\'s just an addictive way to scratch some kind of emotional itch. All right, I\\'ve said my piece about Kalvin. Who\\'s next? Oh how about, Vanessa. We meet again, gorg. And once again, I\\'m wearing some kind of embarrassing anime hairpiece. Vanessa is a trans woman who is, the second most popular political trans YouTuber. At least that\\'s what I wrote in the script when I had more subscribers than her and was fully prepared to be a c*nt about it, but since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again. Good for her. Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel back when SJW cringe was fashionable. She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs but the most consistent theme was transtrenders and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name, they\\'re making us look bad, this why people hate us. So what we can now recognize as a standard ingroup cringe fixation. But Vanessa focused in particular on a strident SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis. And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her where she made a point of misgendering Riley, and dismissing her as a fake transgender who hadn\\'t transitioned and clearly had no intention to. - You know, if you went on estrogen, your sex drive wouldn\\'t be so high and you wouldn\\'t be guilt-tripping people into having sex with you. Just saying. - But then, Riley made a video revealing that she\\'d been on hormone therapy for a year and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery. This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video where she not only apologized to Riley and acknowledged her transition, but she actually went beyond the script of a generic oopsie doopsie YouTube video, and opened up about having experienced herself the cruelty she directed at Riley. - And I\\'m someone who\\'s had my transition picked apart online. There have been Reddit threads and 4Chan threads with hundreds of comments on it, of people trying to prove that I\\'m not trans because I haven\\'t done this or that or, you know, digging up my old pictures, so the thought that this entire time I\\'ve done that exact same thing to someone else and pushed that off on someone else f*cks with me and I\\'m f*cking sorry. - Vanessa actually managed, for one fleeting moment, to make a connection between her own past hurt and trauma and the pain she\\'d inflicted on another person, which is kind of a once in a lifetime event on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths who wouldn\\'t muddy their shoes to save a drowning child, and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists who consume human misery a like glutton gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet. - You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that I should really try to stick to ideas, opinions, policy. - However, this lesson would not last. Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content well past the point it had become passe, making a video with Big Red in the thumbnail as recently as 2019. I admit I thought she was fading to irrelevance. But once again, I underestimated Vanessa. In July 2019, her channel rocketed to a new level of success when she released a video titled \"Exposing Jessica Yaniv: Trans Predator.\" In this video Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman, or rather she believes a man posing as a trans woman, called Jessica Yaniv. Who the f*ck is Jessica Yaniv? Well, as far as I can tell, everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true. Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal to close down several beauty salons that had refused to wax her hairy balls after she approached them about it in an awkward and creepy way. She has a long history of sending extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls. And she attempted to host a topless pool party for unchaperoned children. Basically Yaniv is someone who appropriates the language of transgender acceptance and equality to cloak predatory behavior toward minors. And my read on Yaniv by the way is not that she\\'s a cunning manipulator, but that this is someone who\\'s mentally not playing with a full deck. After the success of her initial video, Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv, re-branding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen, exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them. And at first I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa. At least now she\\'s finally picking on someone who deserves it. But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have. One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story, and the lack of attention given to it by other trans public figures, as an indictment of trans activists, who Vanessa thinks should spend more time sounding the alarm about transgender predators. And I\\'m willing to admit there\\'s probably a valid point in there somewhere. Like, some trans people really are so paranoid about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts, that they basically look the other way and refuse to acknowledge the small but real subset of trans people who are in fact dangerous perverts. But Blaire, you talk about the Yaniv situation like it\\'s urgent breaking news, like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name, but for the stubborn silence of trans activists. But why? Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv? There\\'s more than 100,000 sexual assaults reported to American law enforcement every year, the literal president of America is a bit of a sexual predator himself, why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep? I guess you could argue that since Yaniv is a trans-identified predator-a TIP!- we as real trans people have a responsibility to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her. Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that. And again I think there\\'s maybe some truth to that, like initially the LGBT website PinkNews straightforwardly reported Yaniv\\'s claims of discrimination, which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics. But I don\\'t think that constantly broadcasting updates about the transgender pred- is really the best optics for us either. Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place? Is it simply because she cares deeply about the wellbeing of children and thought making a video exposing Yessica Yaniv is the best way protect them? I mean I\\'m sure she cares a little bit about the children. But it\\'s still a YouTube video. And you have to ask, is the primary intention here really to stop a predator? Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle? Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published, Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel titled \"Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv: Trans Predator.\" This got two million views. Is this what you do with someone you\\'ve just accused of pedophilia? You host a live event debating the pedophile on your YouTube channel? What\\'s to debate? - I don\\'t need to be scared in my own house that I\\'m gonna get f*cking attacked. (electricity crackling) Which is illegal in Canada, just saying. - You think that was like cute? Was that a moment for you. - Then of course you sell T-shirts featuring the meme that resulted from your YouTube pedophile debate. I mean that makes sense. If you\\'re gonna catch a predator, you gotta sell pedophile debate merch! And of course you gotta follow the pedophile\\'s makeup tutorial. You know, for the children. Now, I hate to be overly-critical, but when I look at this I don\\'t see a high-minded activist working to protect children and trans people\\'s image. I see a tabloid entertainer who\\'s discovered a way to monetize milking lols from a mentally defective pervert. And I have to say Blaire, as a connoisseur of trash myself, I\\'m very entertained by all of this. Following a sexual predator\\'s makeup tutorial, that\\'s genius. I wish I\\'d thought of it. But just be honest, this isn\\'t activism, this isn\\'t justice, it\\'s a lolcow cult. It\\'s like one Maury\\'s transsexuals took over the show. And I love that for her. I love that for her. But Blaire, I can\\'t help but notice, you\\'re still hitting all the same beats your videos have always hit. Attention everyone. There is a bad transgender in our midst. The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me. It\\'s very important that all we gather \\'round to condemn this bad transgender who is not a real transgender. And Blaire I\\'ll give you this, you are getting better at choosing your targets. The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture and Yessica Yaniv is good casting for that part. She\\'s a transphobe\\'s bogeyman come to life, and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her. But you\\'ll have to excuse me if I don\\'t take this seriously as anything more than a smarter version of the same ingroup-cringe humilitainment you\\'ve always made. And by the way, you may wanna check in on your understudy Rose of Dawn. Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber who produces a series called \"Trans-Stupid.\" - Hi, everyone. Welcome to another edition of \"Trans-Stupid\", the show where I take a look at the wonderful world LGBTQIA+++ news because stupidity is intersectional. - Transgender, more like, trans-retarded! More like, trans-gay! (laughing) Trans-gay, I love that. I\\'m literally, I just realized, I\\'m literally trans-gay. Rose\\'s channel is allegedly about the excesses of trans ideology and activism, which in theory I do think is a perspective worth including in the conversation. But in practice, well, let\\'s just say Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary about why Chris-Chan is not a real transgender. There is a bad transgender in our midst. The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me. I\\'m getting pretty tired of this. And here\\'s her transition advice to trans women beginning their journey. - You probably have this image in your head that, you know, you\\'re going to be this really cute-looking trans woman, like effectively you\\'re going to be this seal. Like look at this seal. Isn\\'t this seal adorable? You\\'re so cute. But the truth is you\\'re probably not looking like this seal right now, are you? You\\'re probably more like this big bull seal, barging your way into women\\'s bathrooms, saying, this is a woman\\'s body. Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase. In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White. - Rose, no. Do not simp for Vanessa. It only encourages her. She\\'s also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv. Which seems like kind of lot, gorg. Would I be wrong to say I\\'m getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe? In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv\\'s numerous crimes and wrongdoings but she also cannot resist making it very clear how disgusted she is with Yaniv\\'s appearance. - [Rose] The irony being that this kind of tweet came from someone you could smell, just by looking at a picture of them. - I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest at all in white knighting for Yaniv. I do not support her journey, as far as I\\'m concerned she can eat shit, and maybe she does. I wouldn\\'t be surprised. No, my point is that part of the emotional catharsis that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive from making this kind of content, comes from contrasting themselves as good presentable real trans people, with the hideousness of the wretched fake-trans dump truck. A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves. On one half, Vanessa, looking fish, looking c*nt. Always with her lip gloss in the livestreams. And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast, the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig. And I\\'m allowed to say dump truck, because before I transitioned I was once one of Vanessa\\'s dump trucks. I was one of, #HerDumpTrucks. Look I happen to possess a little thing, you probably haven\\'t heard of, called inner beauty. That\\'s right sweetie, my pancreas? Unclockable. (airhorn blowing) Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself with this cartoon, okay, straight-up refers to Yaniv as the Tubby Troon and the Titanic Tranner of Canada. - A particular titanic tranner of Canada. The titanic tranner of Canada. - Tranner and troon beings pejoratives for transgenders that I associate with 4chan, where I\\'m guessing Rose has spent a lot of time. (chimes ringing) As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv\\'s fatness, well I\\'m guessing that must be an important part of stopping a predator, right? - It seems almost taboo to condemn people for how rough they look when I think that that tough love in a way is needed because I look at what I looked like when I first transitioned and Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something, like I looked bad, like I was overweight, I had poor taste in clothes. Like I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything. It was mostly T-shirts and jeans. You\\'re probably more like this big bull seal, barging your way into women\\'s bathrooms, saying, this is a woman\\'s body. Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase. In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White. I want to make it very clear that when I\\'m talking about transition, I don\\'t mean-- - Rose, are you okay? No you\\'re not okay. None of us are okay. No trans woman remotely in the public eye is in any way okay. And look I don\\'t want to take this psychoanalysis too far. Because I don\\'t know from watching YouTube videos what\\'s going on in someone\\'s head. But I can try to make intelligent inferences. And I think it\\'s pretty revealing that this is how Rose introduces the topic of Jessica Yaniv: - One of the biggest characters in the whole f*cking world at the moment, which is Jessica Yaniv. - Rose, gorg, Yessica Yaniv is not one of \"The biggest characters in the world\", at any moment. This is not a world historical figure. At the end of the day, this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend off the streets of Vancouver BC. The only reason anyone has heard of her at all is that Vanessa decided to go full \"To Catch a Predator\" and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity. She\\'s not one of the biggest characters in the world. But it sounds like what she is, Rose, is one of the important characters in your brain. This is distorted thinking. It\\'s like A-Log comparing Chris-Chan to Hitler. You\\'re so deep in the morbid cringe obsession that you\\'ve lost perspective. And I\\'m sure you have what seem to you like perfectly logical reasons for devoting so much attention to this, and I know that videos about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I\\'m sure that\\'s a factor too. But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession when I see one. And I know that being a visible trans woman on the Internet is more difficult than most people can imagine. And I know that pretty much every trans person is bullied or shamed or humiliated at some point in our lives. And I know how good it can feel to take all the horrible things that transphobes and bullies and TERFs have said said about us, and repeat those things verbatim at some big, fat, fake, dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist. Oh, it feels good to get to be the TERF for once. It feels good to be the judge, rather than the judged. Because when you point the finger at someone else, you\\'re also pointing away from yourself. And it\\'s not lost on me that in conservative circles, queer people are often treated like suspected sex criminals by default. So there\\'s safety in being the one who spearheads the think-of-the-children type moral crusade. And when you expose a trans predator, you get that feeling of safety plus the relief of having someone in particular to blame for the shame and the stigma we all feel. Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us. But that\\'s just not true. It\\'s a simple answer to a complicated problem. It\\'s scapegoating. When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube, I see a community trying to cope with stigma, and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief. It\\'s basically a blood sacrifice. It\\'s not rational. It feels good for a moment, but it\\'s an addiction. It won\\'t ever erase the stigma and the shame. And Yaniv is simply the latest and the most deserving in a long line of bad transgenders who aren\\'t real transgenders and are giving us a bad name and are the reason people hate us and must be condemned and destroyed. But when Yaniv is finally gone, when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is, you\\'re just gonna find a new scapegoat to take her place. And the shame cycle continues. The humiliation and bullying we\\'ve experienced is internalized as shame. When we project that shame onto scapegoats and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt. And we voice that contempt by shaming other people, which starts a new cycle. So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags, new shamedumps, new lolcows, and you can wind up like one of the people who\\'s been archiving Chris-Chan for 13 years, but that will never really heal us. God how do I get out of this video? I\\'m trying to have a serious conversation dressed as some kind of catgirl degenerate. Cringe. Shame! I\\'m ashamed. Don\\'t look at me! You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers. Thank you! Yes I suppose it is groundbreaking. All right children, let\\'s review our notes on cringe. The word cringe really describes two different emotions, either embarrassment or contempt. You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else. When you\\'re embarrassed for someone else we call that vicarious embarrassment. And that can mean cringing with someone who is embarrassed themselves, which I\\'ve argued is excluded in the internet usage of the word cringe. Or it can mean embarrassment for someone who isn\\'t embarrassed themselves, in which case we say we\\'re cringing at them. Now if someone who\\'s part of your ingroup is embarrassing themselves, and by proxy embarrassing the ingroup that includes you, you feel ingroup cringe, which can involve both vicarious embarrassment and a kind of self-cringe. And on the contempt side, contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you, particularly if they\\'re traits you have contempt for in yourself, can develop into morbid cringe, which is that obsession with a lolcow, that addiction to contemptuous gazing at a dark mirror in which you see reflected everything you hate about yourself, or about your ingroup. Now I want to end this video by reflecting on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful. And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good. Embarrassment serves a social purpose, it helps us interact smoothly with each other by telling us what not to do. And empathizing with other people\\'s embarrassing stories can be cathartic, it can make you feel closer to other people, more alike, less alone. I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe is very healthy. It shows you\\'re self-aware, and you care at least a little bit what other people think. You know I\\'ve met people who never cringe at themselves. And, let\\'s just say they\\'re not my kind of people. They\\'re narcissists who think super highly of themselves regardless of how they\\'re actually coming across. But I think partly out of fear of ending up like one of those people, I\\'ve overcompensated, and I cringe too much, both at myself and at other people. It\\'s a habit that is making me hate myself, and it\\'s making me unfairly contemptuous towards others. And when I take a look around the Internet, like I\\'ve done in this video, I find that I\\'m not alone in this situation. And it\\'s not cute. So, how do we cringe less? Well, the cliché solution is self-love, which our culture places a lot of value on, self-love and self-esteem. You know, I don\\'t care what haters and losers say, I\\'m a bad bitch, I look like a supermodel, I\\'m a genius. We\\'re encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way. But it doesn\\'t work. Because it\\'s not realistic. You don\\'t look like a supermodel. And you\\'re not a genius. And when you realize that, you fall from one extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls, \"The self-esteem Tower of Terror.\" So you go from self-love to self-hate. But self-hate is also a distortion. Recently I was listening to a David Foster Wallace interview, yeah, I know, cringe, and he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked. He said, \"There is a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.\" How dare you notice that. I\\'m in this photo and I don\\'t like it. But it\\'s true. Time spent cringing at yourself is time spent obsessing over yourself. And it\\'s hard not to because humans are animals, so our perspective is egocentric by nature. But we can learn to appreciate that the world is bigger than us. I mean, I\\'ve heard rumors. In that book we started with, \"Cringeworthy\", Melissa Dahl advocates not self-love, or self-hate, but what she calls \"Self-indifference.\" She says, \"Self-indifference is the relief \"of realizing that you are simply not that big a deal.\" So yeah, I was cringey in the past, and I\\'m still pretty cringey now. But you know what? Everyone else is pretty cringey too. And the world is probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway so, I don\\'t know if I would call this good news but, if it\\'s any consolation, Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. (dreamy ethereal music)',\n",
       " 3: ' ♪ \"Flower Duet\" by Delibes/Zoë Blade ♪ - All right children, it\\'s a new decade, it\\'s time to face the facts. How do I put this delicately? Your humble hostess is a total lez. Ugh, shame! You\\'re probably worried this is a coming out video, and I\\'m sorry to tell you that it is, but, oh, it\\'s so much worse than just that. You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune, two, looks like carelessness, and three, well, at that point you\\'re just doing it for attention. And I do love attention, I wanna be very clear about that, but I also happen to be gay. Some gay people love attention. It\\'s been known to happen. So there comes a time in a woman\\'s life when you have to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror, and admit this is some high key lesbicious behavior. And I\\'m gonna talk you through how I got to that point. So, storytime! I fell in love with my best friend. Storytime! Telling my boyfriend I\\'m a lesbian. Storytime! My parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang. Exposed! Graphic! The tea is piping hot! For a long time on this channel my official story has been that I\\'m bi. I\\'m super fucking bi. But I haven\\'t dated women since I transitioned, and for a while there, I got pretty deep into the straight lifestyle. This really started in 2018. By that summer I had privately convinced myself that I was a fully heterosexual woman. Unhh! And we\\'re gonna circle back to how I reached that conclusion, but I\\'m starting in the middle of things, I\\'m like an epic poet. Hail Muse! Hey how are you gorg! So, at the beginning of 2018 I became close friends, I\\'d even say best friends, with a woman whomst I\\'ll call. Joanne. Light of my life. Can we get some melodramatic music please? Yeah, here we go. You\\'re gonna wanna pour yourself a glass of something nice. I want you to fully enjoy my pain. So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast. It was that kind of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and in jokes, and you drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter. We\\'d call each other pretty much every day and we\\'d talk for hours. And I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever called her and not been laughing or smiling in the first twenty seconds, which is very unusual for me, because I am a weird, and I don\\'t get along that well with so many people. One reason we got so emotionally close is, we\\'re both trans. And there\\'s a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that I can share with another trans woman, that I can\\'t really have with anyone else. Oh, and by the way, Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful, which I did notice every time I looked at her. And from the beginning of this relationship, it wasn\\'t sexual, but it wasn\\'t exactly platonic either. We\\'d get drunk and make out, we\\'d sleep in the same bed and cuddle. Straight girls do that right? Gal pals! I remember one of the first times I hung out with Joanne we got our nails done together. And that night, we were barhopping and she took my pretty hand in her pretty hand and we walked down the street together holding hands. This is a garbage and I wanna die! I hope you all know that I\\'m in agony. Later we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink we\\'d run off to the bar and she\\'d secretly kiss me. Ugh, it\\'s still one of the most magical gay things that\\'s ever happened to me. Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn\\'t care. A lot of men think girls kissing is hot, but they don\\'t take it seriously. They don\\'t think it could ever mean anything or lead to a real relationship. Gal pals! Just kill me. Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home, and they won\\'t notice. So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year, without me acknowledging to Joanne or to myself that I was falling in love. So, not only was I in denial about being in love with her, but at the same time, I had basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men. So how could I possibly think that? Well, the short answer is shame. Why is no one talking about the shame? I was so ashamed of my attraction to women that there were days I thought the shame was gonna crush me to death. Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad. And let no one say I didn\\'t make a strong attempt. There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in the town square, with the inscription, \"Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual.\" I\\'m a bronze star lesbian. Well, if we\\'re really being honest, I don\\'t think I get a star. Oh I was desperate to be straight. I tried prayer, I tried electric shocks. All the classics, all the hits. You know the idea is if you shock yourself every time you think about women, you start to associate the two in your head. So now I\\'m a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks. This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I\\'m on a road trip with Cate Blanchett. So at some point the shame was just too much for me, and it literally broke my brain. I no longer wanted to be straight, I simply deluded myself into thinking I was straight. Maybe a little bi. A little bit. By that time I\\'d started dating men, and I got into a serious long-term relationship with a man. And at first I explained away my feelings for Joanne by telling myself, female friendships are just really intense, that\\'s probably why I feel so strongly. And everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it\\'s only natural I\\'d notice that, and, you know, spend a lot of time thinking about it. So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year. And then, two things happened. First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian. (dramatic Music) Fuck my drag, right? I think before that, I always knew she was bi, but some combination of self-interested denial and biphobia allowed me to write off my initial crush on her as, I just have a thing for my straight best friend. Like, who doesn\\'t? But that\\'s a very self-serving narrative because it quarantines your feelings inside the safety of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain of potential rejection. \\'Cause that way it\\'s not really me, she\\'s rejecting, it\\'s just, she\\'s just not that into women. But once she started dating women, I couldn\\'t tell myself that anymore. And the jealousy hit me so hard I couldn\\'t ignore it. Second, around that same time, Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks, it was a long distance friendship. And about halfway through that visit, I cracked. One morning, I woke up next to her-gal pals! And I looked at her pretty fucking face and I had the thought, I wanna wake up next to you every day of my life. And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual biogirl to have about her gal pal. Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone. Like what the fuck is this? What am I feeling? I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of 19th century Italian opera. So I confessed my feelings to Joanne, and-love confession gone wrong! Devastating! she did not reciprocate my feelings. Nurse! My pain is at a 10, I need more pills! Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah. I\\'m sure we all know how that goes. And here\\'s the thing, if we\\'d taken a three-month friendship break right then and there, I might have recovered. But we couldn\\'t keep away from each other. She wasn\\'t in love with me but She must have been in something with me because the truth is we were never just gal pals. And I was beyond reason, like, I probably would\\'ve started one of those lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts, that\\'s how tragic this got. Those are great by the way. Pay no attention to bitter queens. So for the rest of 2019 Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other, and I just repeated this heartbreak again and again and again. Now, if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would\\'ve come out as gay last year. Because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating shame. But rejection and the heartbreak are shameful in themselves, and only made the situation worse. So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial, until finally, last October, I got super fucking canceled on Twitter, as discussed in my last video. Link in the description! Subscribe! And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was gonna have to be the one to enforce a friendship break, otherwise I was never gonna get over her. So there was this combination of things, being politically canceled by Twitter, being romantically canceled by Joanne, and also losing her as my closest friend, which sent me into a catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression. And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a purpose. Because depression brings your life to standstill, and in the quiet of that standstill you sometimes feel outside yourself. And with that comes a new perspective. So last December, when I was lying around drinking White Claw all day and binge-watching Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn\\'t feel so much shame anymore, and that gave me a new kind of clarity. I looked back on the last couple years and I saw that I\\'d been avoiding the obvious. So, that\\'s what it took for me to finally face the fact that I am a, I am a gay. Not clickbait. (fey music) Adam\\'s a great guy and all but... I want Lilith. Shame! This floral fantasy is a little less mother of mankind, and a little more Coachella 2015. Well that\\'s my Eden! Candy flipping! I love it! Ok, let\\'s circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches of the straight agenda. It starts with denial, and there\\'s two sides to gay denial. First there was the period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women. \"Female friendships are just really intense, straight girls have girl crushes too.\" And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought was sexual and romantic attraction to men. And to be honest, I\\'m still kind of struggling to make sense of all this. Maybe I\\'m not quite ready to make this video, but I\\'m afraid that if I don\\'t, the shame will overpower me again, and I\\'ll slide back into denial. So, while I\\'m still thinking semi-clearly, lemme talk you through the struggle. Because like most queer people, I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis of my own personality. She\\'s a Libra! So in 2017 I started taking feminizing hormones. Most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that, like it makes you grow breasts, at least in theory. I just added progesterone. I will see if that does anything. But the lesser known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality. The first few months I was on hormones I actually wondered if I was now asexual, because the libido I had known before was just gone. But I\\'m very much not asexual, it just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive. One of the differences for me is it\\'s not as obvious now whomst I\\'m attracted to. Just looking at an attractive person, well let\\'s put it this way, it sparks my interest, but it doesn\\'t light my fire. It\\'s not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust. Instead it\\'s a slow burn that has to be built up. Some people call this demisexual, which is a term I\\'m ambivalent about, but I think the concept it describes applies to me. Like I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever, but I don\\'t feel intense sexual attraction to anyone until I\\'ve gotten close to them as a friend. So I have hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know? Can\\'t I just find a new best friend, fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay married? I know that\\'s not how this works. I have to play the field. I also think it\\'s a reason I don\\'t really like porn that much. Because sex without context is just mechanics to me. It\\'s boring. The build-up of desire, that\\'s the interesting part, and the struggle between desire and shame, I shouldn\\'t, but I want to. That\\'s how you build a plotline kids. I\\'m also guessing that this kind of slow-burn sexuality is more common in women than in men. And I wonder if that\\'s a reason why gay men tend to know they\\'re gay at an earlier age than gay women. When you have teenage boy testosterone levels it\\'s harder to be agnostic or mistaken about who you\\'re attracted to. Whereas there\\'s a lot of gay women who don\\'t realize they\\'re gay until they\\'re under 30s, or even later. And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad about my wasted youth. So it\\'s hard for me to use visual sexual interest as a guide to my sexuality. Because I do feel aesthetic attraction towards beautiful people of any gender, and I can be pretty intense in its own right. I guess the difference for me is looking at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating to me than looking at a beautiful man, which can be moving, in it\\'s own way but it\\'s more like the way I\\'m moved by, I don\\'t know, the Parthenon. You know it\\'s sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns. And that\\'s not to say it\\'s totally asexual I mean I\\'d fuck the Parthenon. I\\'d fuck it so hard. I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity, and maybe that stems from my pre-transition sense of having failed at masculinity, so I\\'m mesmerized by the real thing? There\\'s something about the contrast between me and a masculine man that\\'s sexually intriguing to me. Like I\\'ve sometimes pleasantly gasped at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms enfolding my smooth, fragile body. Eee! Or maybe it\\'s more Freudian. The masculine man as daddy, the archetypal father. The symbolic power of the phallus. Penetration as the ultimate expression of desire and possession. There\\'s a lot of sexual connotations to manhood, and I think that\\'s why I can look at a sexy man and create plausible fantasies in my head, where I\\'d absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me. And I can find things I like about male bodies. Like, they\\'re very warm. I love it when you get under the covers with a man and he warms you up. But that\\'s when the lesbian voice comes into my head and says, but are you attracted to men? Or do you just like being warm? My attraction to women is very different. I look at a beautiful woman and it\\'s just like oh nooooo you\\'re gorgeous you\\'re beautiful this is going to destroy me. You know it can actually be painful how beautiful a woman is. I\\'ve never once been in pain over male beauty. But around Joanne, once I was open about my feelings and things got bad, there\\'d be moments I\\'d have to just look away from her and be like, don\\'t even enter my line of sight right now, you\\'re too beautiful, I can\\'t stand it. There\\'s a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone who doesn\\'t want you back. It\\'s insatiable, like an addiction. And on the flipside, there\\'s an intense erotic thrill in being desired. I think that\\'s what got me interested in men in the first place. It\\'s that they were interested in me. And that\\'s pretty interesting. I\\'ve felt desired by men in a way I\\'ve never truly felt desired by women. You know a man will glower at you with that agitated carnivorous desperation. Fuck me up king! God that\\'s hot. Gets me every time. But notice how excitement at the attention, the flattery of being desired, is not the same thing as attraction to men. You know, there\\'s a difference between, \"I want you.\" and, \"I like that you want me.\" But for a long time I confused one for the other. And one reason I was able to do that is that the normative sexual role for women is to be pursued, possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men. It\\'s all very passive. And in most of the sexual encounters I\\'ve had with men, I\\'ve taken a very submissive role. Sometimes I just submit to the glower, and let him do things to me. And I do think that the thrill of being desired is a valid thing to want. I like that feeling myself, and I do genuinely enjoy taking on a more submissive role sometimes, but you have to go about it thoughtfully. Because if you don\\'t, sexual submission can be a way to avoid confronting what your desires actually are. It\\'s freedom from freedom. And if you\\'re ashamed of your sexual orientation, and ashamed of your transsexual body, and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all because of stigma about trans women being fetishists, then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires by letting someone else take control, can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all. And for a while it\\'s almost be the only way I could enjoy it. And I was able to convince myself that was normal, because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women isn\\'t really that much more liberated. Like I read 50 Shades of Grey years ago and totally identified with the fantasy, and later I thought that was evidence I had normative female desires. Never mind that I was identifying with the midlife crisis fantasies of a repressed English housewife longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant. I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy a healthier version of that fantasy, I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer under a kind of feminist guilt about that. But what makes me different is that for me submission to a man was simply the only way I could enjoy sex without shame. And that\\'s a lot of what I did for a couple years, even though my real sexual attraction is to women. Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation, straight women are ultimately attracted to men, and sexually aroused by male bodies. Or are they? Gay men certainly are, and gay women are just rhapsodic about women, but a lot of straight women are just kind of meh about male bodies and men in general. What is that about? I just... I just I do not understand straight women. I don\\'t think I ever will. And that\\'s okay. I\\'m just gonna accept my bewilderment, and move on with my lesbian life. Now, what I\\'ve been giving you so far is a retrospective analysis, an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years. But you have to understand that when I was living through this, I experienced it very differently, because I didn\\'t have these insights. So I wasn\\'t thinking, oh I\\'m not really attracted to men, but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them, so I\\'m gonna pursue that to distract myself from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women. No, subconsciously I put my attraction to women on mute, at least until Joanne ruined my life. And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men, which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy. I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half, who I had very genuine feelings for. Plot twist! Storytime! So my ex-boyfriend, let\\'s call him Chad. Oh, and he was a Chad, like full Giga-Chad fantasy. You know, he was very masculine, taller than me, objectively attractive, very charming. Straight women used to tell me all the time they were jealous of me for being with him. And obviously I loved that. To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood, a sort of archetypal romantic lead who swept me off my feet and fulfilled my sick fantasies of being a heterosexual woman. Now you probably think I\\'m gonna say that he was just an abstract fantasy to me, but that once it came to actually dating I realized I didn\\'t like it. But honestly, it\\'s more complicated than that. Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him. And, I still think of him as the one genuine boy crush of my life. When we started dating, it was really exciting. I never had a boyfriend before, and he\\'d never been with a trans woman before, and we had this adorably heterosexual energy together, like holding hands in the park. It was cute! This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a cad. But he wasn\\'t. He was great. He took a very good care of me, he was never ashamed to be seen with me, or of his friends and family knowing he was dating me, which, if you\\'re a trans woman, that\\'s a huge deal. He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself, and when I was with him I was not ashamed. And that meant a lot. So, I really wanted this to work, like, if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one. And for a year or so, I thought it was working. I enjoyed the time we spent together, I missed him when he was gone, I told him I loved him and I meant it. But what happened is by the end of the first year, the initial excitement died down, and while Chad was ready to keep escalating the relationship, I was realizing that something was very seriously emotionally wrong on my end, there was something missing. And when I realized I was in love with Joanne, I was like, there\\'s that missing feeling. And I started to understand what my problem was. Then, last Fall, I posted to Instagram an aloof picture of me with the caption, Do I actually like men? Or do I just like attention? And I didn\\'t mean anything serious by that. I was just joking around. you know you can post something like that, and a bunch of straight women will respond like, \"Yeah, fuck men!\" What is their damage? Well, they\\'re stuck dating men. That\\'s their damage. But a few people left comments saying, oh are you making a video about comphet? You should make a video about comphet. And I was like, what the f*ck is comphet? So I googled it and I learned that comphet is short for compulsory heterosexuality. Basically it\\'s the idea that heterosexuality is socially required of women, and it\\'s so bound up with the conventional idea of what it even means to be a woman, that gay women often mistakenly believe for years that they\\'re attracted to men. And this Google search led me to a reddit post called the \"Am I a Lesbian Masterdoc\", and I\\'m reading through this post like, oh no, this sounds terribly familiar. Quote, \"compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head that says I must really be het even when I\\'m in love with a woman.\" Quote, \"you have every reason to be happy in your relationship with a man, but you just aren\\'t, everything is going really well, but something is missing and you can\\'t figure out what.\" So next thing you know, I\\'m doing tequila shots at 3 a.m. and taking \"Am I a Lesbian\" Internet quizzes that were clearly designed for 13-year-olds. And I\\'m fully a 31-year-old transsexual taking this quiz like, \"It\\'s true, Samantha was right, I am a total lez!\" All the cis gay people watching this video probably wanna kill me right now, \\'cause y\\'all figured this shit out in high school and I\\'m sitting here in my 30s like [Unintelligible whining] Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay for 30 minutes of my lifetime please? Is that alright with you, the gays? So, to be honest, I still experience comphet thoughts and fantasies. Like, for a long time I\\'ve had what seem to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man. But after a lot of introspection I\\'ve realized that this is not really a fantasy of private happiness and fulfillment. It\\'s a fantasy of a social prestige and acceptance. Like, can you imagine if I got married to a tall, handsome man, at an opulent wedding with lots of photographers posting to Instagram? Ugh, I\\'d be queen of the trannies! I\\'d be a super heckin valid uwu. But I don\\'t actually wanna be married, I wanna get married. I wanna have a wedding. Basically, I wanna wear a wedding dress. I want attention, okay? Please pay, pay attention to me. So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy, but it\\'s still really hard for me to let it go. I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality. Because there\\'s a level of gender instability and deviancy that\\'s inherent to homosexuality, and until recently I wasn\\'t secure enough in my gender to handle that. Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood, and I think I needed to go through the more 101 straight girl experience before attempting anything as difficult as that. I still have a hard time imagining a happy future for myself as a woman partnered to a woman, and I think that\\'s partly because good lesbian representation in media is so sparse. The best we have is a Showtime melodrama from 15 years ago, which I do like and I like the new one too. But after that, the runner up is maybe not the lesbian representation we need, it\\'s a YouTube show about two drag queens whomst we ship. Well, I don\\'t ship them because I have a fully lesbian parasocial Internet crush on Katya Zamolodchikova. Don\\'t laugh at me! She\\'s smart, she\\'s funny, she\\'s beautiful, that\\'s everything I\\'m looking for in a woman. Sure some haters and losers will probably try to convince me that Katya is in fact a homosexual man posing as a woman but you know what? This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life, and I don\\'t need this right now. I need to be touched by a real woman. I\\'m, I\\'m losing my goddamn mind. It\\'s so deeply embedded in our culture that marrying a man is the end-goal of womanhood. And it\\'s not just Disney movies, like, it\\'s the Bible, it\\'s Greek mythology, German fairytales, Victorian novels. The whole weight of cultural history is telling you that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man. And if you\\'re already super dysphoric and insecure about your gender, then to reject that possibility, ahhhh it hurts. It hurts so bad. But whenever I think about having a long-term partner, you know, not the wedding day, but the 1000th morning waking up together, I can only imagine her being a woman. My brain wants a good man to take care of me. But my heart wants a high-maintenance diva to ruin my life. And once I knew that for sure, I thought it would be wrong to stay with Chad. And this man was like my hinge, he was holding me together, but last December I broke up with him because I\\'m a lesbian, which at least it\\'s a good reason. I\\'m having a hard time you guys. Leave your pity in the comments. And I\\'m starting to regret eating that fruit too, I feel like shit. I think it\\'s the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me. I could really use a couple Advil and vodka tonic. I think I might throw some clothes on too. Where\\'s that snake? ♪ \"Flower Duet\" ♪ Ugh, I already miss my heterosexual nails. I know these are too long to be gay, but baby steps, okay. This is hard for me. Getting my acrylics removed? Traumatizing. I feel like I\\'m detransitioning! One of these days I will do the lesbian manicure with acrylics on eight fingers. I just have to find the courage to walk into the salon and say, \"Hi, I\\'m a homosexual, please. I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy.\" Shame! Let\\'s talk about the shame. Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women though, two of those women later turned out to be trans so, I guess we had some way of finding each other. And attraction to women was never really a problem for me before the transgendering, because, I was raised in an alternative lifestyle where men are supposed to be attracted to women. Crazy, I know. Not that I\\'m a newcomer to shame, because, oh, sweaty I was doing plenty of things that men are not supposed to do. And before I transitioned my shame was centered around my being at the time a gender non-conforming man, which in my early YouTube videos I dealt with by caricaturing myself and basically leaning in to the public humiliation. One of my classic techniques. But now, my shame is centered around my failure to be a socially acceptable woman, and the most glaring aspects of that failure are my male past, my sexual orientation, and the severed human heads in my refrigerator. Killing all those people was not my most feminine moment, but I was having a bad skin day, what was I supposed to do? There\\'s two problems that kind of multiply together. One, I\\'m ashamed of being trans, two, I\\'m ashamed of being a lesbian, and whatever one times two is, I\\'m really ashamed of being a trans lesbian. Ugh. It\\'s difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride. Why is no one talking about the shame? Because we\\'re ashamed of the shame. But we shouldn\\'t be. The shame is a natural result of shaming. I grew up in a media era where trans women were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities who deserve the violence they bring upon themselves by existing. And I started my transition in the first year of the Trump administration, when there\\'s been constant vilification of trans people in the press, invading women\\'s bathrooms, forcing our insanity on children, destroying Western civilization with our authoritarian pronouns! It\\'s hard to express just the daily humiliation of being a trans woman under these conditions. Then there\\'s the little jabs people throw at you, like, my laser technician recently told me, \"You must be very courageous to transition, because that is not socially acceptable.\" And then she went back to blasting laser beams into my asshole. And of course there\\'s the Internet, where, you know, I used to spend most of my life before the sadness took over. And I\\'m sure we all know that people on the Internet are a wretched, wretched hoard of bigoted attack helicopters. The whole point of this channel is I try to talk sense to these people, I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives and I try to empathize with their point of view and provide a rational response. But a side effect of all that research is I\\'ve acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self-loathing. It\\'s seeped into my brain and become a part of me. And this lifelong buildup of shame has become a wound at the heart of my existence, and all I can really do about it is compensate by wearing fancy clothes. I may be trash, but I am majestic trash, I am resplendent trash, I am couture trash! And I just bought, a mid-century, gold-trimmed, Venetian blown-glass decanter, which helps me forget the shame and self-loathing that plagues my every moment. Now, I\\'m guessing that a lot of people will be confused about why I\\'m so ashamed of being gay, when I\\'ve already come out as trans, which seems like a bigger deal. To paraphrase what some people have told me, You\\'re already a transgendered, and a freak\\'s a freak, so who cares what kind of freak? Well first of all, I would like to propose a sociological theory. Tiffany\\'s Law: all freaks have a deep psychological need to feel superior to a different type of freak. And trans lesbians are pretty close to the bottom of that pecking order. Who\\'s even left for me to feel superior to, the goddamn Belgians? Fuck this waffle! Second, coming out as trans wasn\\'t as hard for me because I did it incrementally over like eight years. At first I was like well, I\\'m just a man who wears makeup sometimes, and then I was, like actually it\\'s not just clothes and makeup I\\'m pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways, and then I realized, I\\'m not a man at all and I identified as non-binary, and then I started taking hormones, and two months on HRT I woke up one day and said, It\\'s fine I\\'m literally a woman. So by the time I came out as a trans woman that was actually a step up in terms of social acceptability from where I was before. When I was a genderqueer genderfuck I felt like I didn\\'t fit in anywhere. Whereas when I started transitioning to female, even though at first I had a lot of the same problems, there was at least a goal in mind, some possible future where I could lead a normal-ish life as a woman. So the moment I started identifying as a woman was the moment the comphet voice entered my head. Sure I\\'ve never been very attracted to men before, but maybe I\\'m attracted to them now. I\\'m a woman, right? I\\'ve always been a little bi curious and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk. Maybe I can make this work. Let\\'s choose some boys to be attracted to and get to started on this. Of course I wasn\\'t as self-aware as that. My way of explaining it to myself was, I guess hormones just magically changed my sexual orientation to the socially acceptable one, that\\'s super crazy! Shut up you goddamn lesbo! God there\\'s so much pressure on trans women to be extremely gender conforming. And even more so if you\\'re a representative of the community. You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife or else cis people are gonna throw us all in camps. And, early in my transition I kind of worshiped straight trans women. Like, I looked up to them and I wanted to be just like them. Now back then there were a handful of trans lesbians on YouTube trying to make the case to the masses that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing, but in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it. I watched those women get eaten alive. And as a result of my witnessing that at a super fucking vulnerable moment for me, I internalized the message that a trans lesbian is just not an okay thing to be if you wanna be tolerated or respected by anybody other than a handful of communists. So I began my transition with essentially no role model of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian. And it doesn\\'t help that most forms of transphobia are harsher on gay trans women than they are on straight trans women. Like take this trope that trans women are men who transition to creep on women in bathrooms. In response to that, it feels really good to be able to say, \"I\\'m not even attracted to women. I\\'m just a petite heterosexual biogirl. I\\'m surely not some kind of six foot monster who likes women.\" Ugh, shame! Shame! It does make me feel like a monster sometimes, like a mutant that has no place in society. And this shame has actually made it more difficult for me to accept that I\\'m a gay woman, than it was for me to come out as trans in the first place. It\\'s like I made a kind of subconscious bargain where I traded my sexual orientation for my gender identity. So I finally transitioned only to spend the next couple years living with a different kind of denial. And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark. This is painful and incriminating to admit, but not all of my shame came from external bigotry. Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust toward things I saw trans lesbians doing. Like this anime catgirl shit which clearly gets under my skin, and not just because these people have been harassing me for three years. Like, you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit, this queasy combination of the hypersexual and the infantile. I\\'m a heckin\\' catgirl lesbian cumslut. Meow meow girldick nya nya! Here\\'s the 97th picture of my own legs in thigh-high stripey socks uwu. What is that about? Is this how women act? Cis people are gonna see this! They\\'re not gonna let us into women\\'s spaces if we act like that! Now, I\\'m not proud of having these judgmental feelings. But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians. And if I was a different type of YouTuber I could\\'ve turned this into content. At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person, Why are trans lesbians so cringey? They\\'re making things harder for the rest of us girls. And that\\'s the real darkness, isn\\'t it? Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself like an honest American. No, just sitting there in absurd denial of who you are as a person, disparaging your own repressed identity to anyone who will listen. And I\\'m ashamed of that too. I\\'m ashamed I sunk that low. But all you can do is try to get better, and I\\'m trying to get better. I\\'ve broken free of the denial, and now I have to break free of the shame. Because shame is literally ruining my life. I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame, and she said I might wanna mention that one of the reasons she didn\\'t wanna be with me is she\\'d be ashamed to date another trans woman. She said she feels like relationships between trans women are freakish behavior on the outskirts of society with no attempt to integrate. These are very painful words to hear from the woman you\\'re in love with. But I understand why she feels that way. Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women, but I can\\'t be the hinge that connects her to mainstream society. And it\\'s maddening to me that she feels that way, because I would have chosen her over every cis woman in the world. But I\\'m just another worthless freak without the authority of society behind me, so my love doesn\\'t count. Shame! It poisons the soul. You know, who you love, just like what gender you are, is such a basic part of your humanity. And shame about that, cuts to the core of your being. It\\'s not I\\'m ashamed of what I did, it\\'s not I\\'m ashamed of how I feel, it\\'s I\\'m ashamed of who and what I am. And living in that state of mind is garbage. It\\'s a basically hell. Even after I realized my sexuality, I considered just shoving that shit back down and never coming out. I have all these fears about it. I\\'m worried people will take my gender less seriously, I\\'m worried cis women, and straight women I\\'m friends with will get weird about it, I\\'m worried I\\'ll die a lonely useless lesbian, I should\\'ve just married a man \\'cause at least then there\\'d be someone to kill the spiders and fix the fucking sink. I\\'m worried I\\'ll lose my straight male audience on YouTube. Although, I mean, love you boys, and please keep the attention coming \\'cause I need all the validation I can get right now, but, I will be fine without you. And in any case, when has a woman\\'s being a lesbian ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it? I actually thought about marrying a man anyway, just sacrificing my sexual orientation to regain that safe, comfortable, shameless feeling I used to have when walking down the street holding Chad\\'s hand feeling like I\\'d succeeded as a woman. But if I don\\'t deal with this now and work towards accepting myself, then I\\'m just gonna be in the same situation in ten years, when I\\'m 41-years-old and married to a man and having these same feelings. So it\\'s time for this to stop, because literally the only good thing about being gay is doing gay shit. And as long as I\\'m ashamed of my sexuality, no one\\'s gonna wanna do gay shit with me. As I like to say, if you can\\'t love yourself, how in the hell you gonna prop up your narcissistic delusions? Look, I\\'m trying to stay positive. Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now, but just you wait. We all know how trends work. In 10 years being a trans lesbian will be the coolest, hippest, chicest thing imaginable, and all the people who talk shit now will forget they ever said a word. That\\'s right, even the straight trans girls will be making out with each other just for the clout, like, \"We can be lesbians too! We\\'re edgy!\" Oh, it\\'s gonna be Madonna and Britney at the 2003 VMAs all over again, mark my words. And among cis lesbians, oh, it will actually be a sign of prestige to have a trap waifu. I can dream right? One you\\'ve tasted one forbidden fruit, why stop there? (electronic music) (dreamy piano music)',\n",
       " 4: ' (quirky orchestral music) - Okay. Let\\'s get started. (groaning) I literally need a man. I need a man, help! All right, I\\'m gonna get pliers, the lesbian solution. Okay. Let\\'s get started. (\"Silent Night\") I love my king. This is not really the most feminine moment for me, not really my 2020 vibe. But it does proportionize my giant man hands. Nyew, nyew, nyew. (tapping) All right, no one thinks I\\'m cute, let\\'s get started. Okay, look, this video is about canceling, also known as cancel culture, formerly known as call-out culture. And I know you kids know all about this but before I dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow boomers. So listen up oldies, in the lingo of these young avocado-guzzling smartphone addicts who killed Applebee\\'s, canceling is online shaming, vilifying and ostracizing of prominent members of a community by other members of that community. Like so much internet slang, this use of the word canceling started out on black Twitter where a few years ago people, well, mostly women, would tweet \"cancel R. Kelly\" and things like that. You know, it started out as this vigilante strategy for bringing justice and accountability to powerful people who previously had been immune to any consequences for their actions. For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media shaming to topple sexually abusive men in power who couldn\\'t be held accountable in any other way. The promise of canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none, and bring justice to prominent abusers. It\\'s, in a way, the 21st century version of the guillotine, the bringer of justice, the people\\'s avenger. But, also like the guillotine, it can become a sadistic entertainment spectacle. And I wanna make the case that we do have, well, a teensy bit of a Reign of Terror situation on our hands, gorg. Now there\\'s a version of this conversation that\\'s already been had to death, and it goes like this. On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly bitch about how cancel culture is out of control, you can\\'t joke about anything anymore without these Millennial jackals trying to get you in trouble. And the other side is mostly progressive think piece authors who argue that there\\'s no such thing as cancel culture, it\\'s just that powerful people are finally being held accountable for their actions and they can\\'t f*cking handle it so they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints is quite as correct as some people might hope. So, it\\'s a good thing I\\'m here to deliver the truth. He didn\\'t know I was transgender. Story time, emotional, not click bait. Let\\'s start with an example. The most high-profile YouTube canceling of 2019 was the canceling of James Charles. And again, I know you kids remember this, but (sigh) I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders. Put the kettle on, Karen. So James Charles is a 20-year-old beauty guru, which means, boomers, look there\\'s these people who make YouTube videos teaching you how to do makeup. It\\'s worth checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer. I certainly can\\'t. t\\'s pretty bomb, it\\'s lit, (clicks) it\\'s groovy, it\\'s fab, it\\'s far out, man, (mystical sitar music) it\\'s a gas, I fully dig it. Free love, give peace a chance, Nixon\\'s a fascist. So back in May of this year, James\\'s colleague and... mother figure? Fellow YouTube beauty guru, Tati Westbrook, uploaded a 40-minute video accusing James of endorsing a brand of hair vitamins that she, wait, that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins. An enthralling plot line, I know. And this was huge, this was covered in the New York Times. And while Tati was at it, almost as an afterthought to the hair vitamin dispute, she also accused James of being a sexual predator. (sinister music) Now I actually went back and checked Tati\\'s original deleted video. And she actually never uses the phrase sexual predator. It\\'s funny, I remember her calling him that because that became the story on Twitter. But what she actually said was, \"James had tried to trick straight men \"into thinking they\\'re gay.\" - Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he\\'s gay, yet again. - Which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator. But see, this is what cancel culture does, it takes one story and transforms it into a significantly different story. You know, the headline I would write about the James and Tati story might read Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men into thinking they\\'re gay. But cancel culture transforms that story into the headline James Charles is a sexual predator. (sinister music) Interesting, now, I wanna make it clear that my intention here is really not to defend James Charles. I\\'m not a James Charles stan. I\\'m a biological female in my 30s. Close to death, I know, please leave a comment before I die. That said, I do think the statement, \"James Charles is a sexual predator\", is a stretch, to say the least. At least, based on the information I have in December, 2019. So, let\\'s analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens. Cancel culture trope one, (acoustic music) and you should be writing this down, class, because this will be on the test. Cancel culture trope one, presumption of guilt. There\\'s a traditional understanding of justice according to which, before you condemn or punish a person, you hear the accuser\\'s side of the story and the accused\\'s side of the story. You allow both sides to present evidence and only after everyone involved has had a chance to make their case, do you pass sentence and punish the convict. (moaning) Punish me, king. Drinking this is punishment enough. Am I uncanceled yet, please. (laughs) You know in the United States of... (groans) We legally have the presumption of innocence. But canceling does not abide by the law. Canceling is a form of vigilante mob justice. And a lot of times, an accusation is proof enough. Now, that\\'s basically the point of the progressive slogan, \"Believe victims.\" It\\'s a norm that was put into place in progressive spaces because out in the world at large, people generally don\\'t believe victims. But I think it\\'s pretty obvious how \"believe victims\" is a norm that\\'s easy to abuse. Was Tati really James\\'s victim? No, she\\'s not some powerless woman abused by a prominent man in her industry. She\\'s on top of the industry and she wasn\\'t victimized by James at all. I see this case more as she weaponized cancel culture against a business rival. Anyway, before James had even had a chance to respond to Tati\\'s accusation, the story had already gone from \"Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men,\" to \"James Charles tried to trick straight men,\" and from there, it was generalized into, \"James Charles is toxic and manipulative,\" which brings us to cancel culture trope two, abstraction. Abstraction replaces the specific concrete details of a claim with a more generic statement. In the transition from \"Tati Westbrook accused James Charles of trying to trick straight men,\" to \"James Charles is toxic and manipulative,\" we\\'ve lost not only the sense of this being an unverified accusation, but we\\'ve also lost all the specific details. \"James Charles is toxic and manipulative\" is an incredibly vague statement and may as well be \"James Charles is bad.\" But even without the presumption of guilt, if someone tells me James Charles is accused of toxic and manipulative behavior, I\\'m gonna think oh, that sounds pretty bad. And I\\'m gonna start speculating about the specifics. And whatever my imagination comes up with is likely going to be worse than whatever he\\'s actually accused of. Also, the specific accusation that he tried to trick straight men into thinking they\\'re gay is self-evidently kind of questionable. How do you trick straight men into thinking they\\'re gay? If you find out, let me know. It\\'s bad, I\\'m bad, I\\'m super bad. This is not a problem that straight men usually seem to have. At the very least, it requires further explanation. It\\'s the kind of story that sounds like it has more than one side. So I\\'m immediately gonna feel a little bit skeptical of the accusation, and I\\'m also gonna side eye Tati Westbrook because this accusation is setting off my homophobia detection alarm. (siren blaring) Leave the gays alone! But I\\'m not gonna have an opportunity to pick up on the potential homophobia and be skeptical of it, if all I\\'ve heard about the situation is James Charles\\'s toxic and manipulative. And I also want to point out a linguistic shift that\\'s happening here. When the claim was James Charles tried to trick straight men, the verbs in the sentence were \"try\" and \"trick.\" So what we\\'re criticizing here is James\\'s behavior, we\\'re criticizing things he did, allegedly, trying to trick straight men. But once the claim morphs into \"James Charles is toxic and manipulative,\" the verb in the sentence is \"is\", \"to be\", so these adjectives are characteristics of James, and it\\'s now not his actions we\\'re criticizing, but his personality, his toxicity, his manipulative-ness. This is what I\\'ll call cancel culture trope three, essentialism. Essentialism is when we go from criticizing a person\\'s actions to criticizing the person themselves. We\\'re not just saying they did bad things, we\\'re saying they\\'re a bad person. And that\\'s what takes us from \"James Charles tried to trick straight men,\" to \"James Charles is a sexual predator.\" So here, we\\'re targeting James himself, not just his actions, but the type of person he is. A sexual predator. (sinister music) And we\\'ve also really escalated the accusation. Because I don\\'t know about you guys, but when I hear the phrase sexual predator, the image that comes to mind is a rapist or a child molester, maybe an abusive boss, not a teenage twink hung up on wanting to date straight guys. I mean, not that a person like that couldn\\'t be a sexual predator, but I really don\\'t think that he\\'s a sexual predator is a fair summary of the accusation. So this seems to me like a pretty nasty and dishonest twisting of the story, and it happened instantaneously on Twitter. It totally dominated the conversation in a community of millions of people for weeks. In a few days, James had lost millions of subscribers and who knows what effect it had on his personal life. Not that anyone\\'s seems to care. In fact, most people seemed to be enjoying his downfall. He was a teenage millionaire, a young, beautiful superstar. Easy to envy, easy to resent, hard to relate to, hard to sympathize with. What was the point of canceling James Charles? Did we want to teach him a lesson? Did we want him to learn from his mistakes and grow as a person? Imagine actually wanting someone to learn, imagine actually caring. My hunch is that the average BeauTube viewer was not sincerely outraged and hurt by their sincere belief that James Charles was a sexual predator. In other words, this was not a case of triggered SJWs, this was a controversy manufactured from the top by a handful of seemingly vindictive and envious people. I honestly think that most of the \"James Charles is a sexual predator\" crowd just wanted to bring him down a peg. Cancel culture trope four, pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism. If you look at the world we live in, would you say that people are usually motivated by a sense of moral integrity and intellectual rigor? No, maybe not. Let\\'s be real America, we are a bunch of morally impotent meatbags, constantly sh*tting ourselves out of fear and lust. For Tati, calling out James, this was really, it was about the hair vitamins, right? I think sis was super salty that this millionaire kid, who she had supported and helped, had betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand. And accusing him of trying to trick straight men was just a twist of the knife. But moralism or intellectualism provide a phony pretext for the call-out. You can pretend you just want an apology, you can pretend you\\'re just a concerned citizen who wants the person to improve. You can pretend you\\'re simply offering up criticism, when what you\\'re really doing is attacking a person\\'s career and reputation out of spite, envy, revenge, I mean, it could be any motivation. Twitter viewed James as an over-privileged, spoiled little brat, and it was fun to wipe the smile off his smug face, at least for a few weeks. It\\'s schadenfreude, right, this kind of petty sadism. Maybe not the internet\\'s proudest moment but not the most shameful either. And that\\'s not to say that everyone canceling James Charles was insincere. But there\\'s a world of difference between \"cancel R. Kelly\" and \"cancel James Charles.\" And I\\'m interested to know how these two things came to look the same. (ominous music) When James was being canceled, I remember being kind of transfixed by the sight of his life and career falling from the sky, full tailspin, black smoke spewing out. A lot of my YouTube friends were like, \"Lol, did you see James Charles was canceled? \"L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-L.\" But I looked up at James and I said oh god, that\\'s gonna be me someday. Stay strong sister, don\\'t let the bastards get you down. Let\\'s switch over to White Claw, these are cute, these are fun, a little more of a feminine moment for me. They didn\\'t even have these last time I was an alcoholic. I\\'m not even wearing makeup. I don\\'t need make-up to serve a full biological fantasy. (laughing) Keep drinking, people, we\\'re gonna make it through this together. So I was doing a little Twitter archeology when I was looking into the James Charles canceling and I found a bunch of tweets referencing earlier James Charles scandals. \"Y\\'all forgiving James Charles? \"He\\'s still a transphobe. \"Y\\'all are acting like just because James Charles \"has receipts, he\\'s no longer a racist transphobe, like... \"James Charles is racist, ableist, transphobic \"and a sexual predator. \"A white woman, y\\'all are being too harsh on him \"and he\\'s uncanceled.\" So according to Twitter, James Charles is not only a sexual predator, (sinister music) he\\'s also a racist and a transphobe. That sounds pretty serious. Let\\'s investigate. We\\'ll start with the transphobia allegation. Cat girls of the jury, exhibit A. - So you\\'re not even full gay? - I mean, no, there have been girls in the past that I thought were really beautiful. There\\'s also been trans guys in the past too that I would really really into for a moment in time. - And I oop. As they say on Twitter, \"yikes.\" \"This ain\\'t it chief.\" (quirky jingling music) \"Friendly reminder that this isn\\'t a good look.\" \"Maybe don\\'t be transphobic? Disappointing.\" So James did f*ck up here. The problem is he\\'s suggesting that being attracted to trans men makes him less gay, which implies that trans men aren\\'t really men, which is at odds with the way trans men understand themselves. So this does deserve criticism, no doubt, no doubt. However, what I see when I look at this clip of James is not a dyed-in-the-wool transphobic bigot, I see a very young person who\\'s still working on understanding his own sexuality and is trying to figure out where his attraction to trans men fits into that. And it seems to me that the proportionate response to that situation is for someone to take James aside and explain to him, \"Look, here\\'s why what you said \"is hurtful to trans men and here are some tips on how \"to avoid saying that kind of thing in the future.\" You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred. Not understanding someone is not the same as wanting them dead. Of course, there are committed bigots who it\\'s just a waste of time to engage with, but sometimes just talking to someone with a little patience and understanding is all it takes. But that\\'s not what cancel culture does, oh no, we have to immediately escalate every situation to the highest possible level of conflict. So by abstraction, we get \"James Charles made transphobic comments.\" And by essentialism, we get, \"James Charles is a transphobe.\" We don\\'t give him a chance to reflect, we don\\'t give him an opportunity to learn, we go straight to branding him a bigot. Nonetheless, that same week, James posted an apology to his Insta story saying, \"Regardless of whatever my intentions were, \"that came across as me saying I\\'m not fully gay \"because I have been with a trans man \"and that is absolutely, first of all, not true, \"like, that doesn\\'t make me not fully gay, \"but that stereotype and implication \"is really, really dangerous and I\\'m very, very sorry. \"If you are a trans man, you are a man. \"If you\\'re a trans girl, you are a woman, \"you are valid in your identity.\" Could you ask for a better apology? Like he not only apologizes for what he said but he also demonstrates a clear understanding of why it was wrong. So does that mean people stopped calling him a transphobe? Of course not. cancel culture trope five, no forgiveness. Cancelers will often dismiss an apology as insincere, no matter how convincingly written or delivered. And of course, an insincere apology is further proof of what a machiavellian psychopath you really are. Now sometimes, a good apology will calm things down for a while, but the next time there\\'s a scandal, the original accusation will be raised again, as if you never apologized. And that\\'s what happened to James during the Tati scandal when Twitter decided he was a transphobic sexual predator. (sinister music) And that\\'s to say nothing of this racism I\\'ve been hearing about. Here are the receipts, exhibit B. In February, 2017, when James was much less famous than he is now, he tweeted, \"I can\\'t believe we\\'re going to Africa today, \"O-M-G, what if we get Ebola? \"James we\\'re fine, we could have gotten \"it at Chipotle last year.\" Okay, well that\\'s a little insensitive, maybe, it\\'s not really something an influencer should tweet. And fear of disease associated with Africa, I mean, I can see how it\\'s in the same vague conceptual area as certain racist tropes, but clearly, this was intended as a joke about his friend mistaking Ebola for E.coli, right? And anyway, he did apologize saying, \"As a white cis male, I recognize my privilege \"and would never want to take that for granted. \"But I f*cked up. \"I feel awful for posting what I said. \"I understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant.\" And James hasn\\'t made a habit of making jokes like that ever since, so is this one tweet from two years ago that he apologized for on its own enough evidence for us to justify labeling him a racist? Well, according to cancel culture, absolutely. Abstraction takes us from, \"Two years ago, \"James Charles made a joke that referenced his fear \"of getting Ebola in Africa,\" to \"James Charles made \"a racist joke.\" And then essentialism takes us to \"James Charles is a racist.\" (sighs) Look, I want to pause to say I really do believe in social justice, at least as much as trash like me believes in anything. And believe me, I am well aware that jokes, irony and even complaints about cancel culture are often used by bigots to cloak their real agenda. The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video about how far-right racists use jokes and memes and mockery of SJWs as a way to camouflage their hateful beliefs and make them more palatable to a wider audience. So I\\'m coming at this from a place of a genuine concern for anti-racism and anti-transphobia, as well as an awareness of the fact that cancel culture is often just a conservative red herring used to shut down any and all complaints about racism or transphobia. But I\\'ve also become very disillusioned with the way these accusations are thrown around so frivolously on social media. By the way they\\'re used to escalate conflict, instead of promote understanding. And by the way they\\'re sometimes weaponized to destroy people who have made mistakes but who really don\\'t deserve to be destroyed. Now, maybe you\\'re thinking, destroyed? What do you mean destroyed? James is a 20 year old millionaire on his way to owning his own makeup empire. And you are completely correct. If you\\'re James Charles, if you\\'re a superstar, then being canceled most likely does not destroy you. The cancelers blend into the general backdrop of haters and they can set you back a few million subscribers and a lot of emotional turmoil, but in the long run, they can\\'t really touch your success. But here\\'s the thing, what if you\\'re not James Charles? What if you\\'re a small creator? What if you can\\'t afford public relations help? What if you belong to a marginalized community and you rely on that community for support? Well in that case, it\\'s a whole different story. (muffled techno music) Let\\'s Irish up this coffee. (glugging) (ice sloshing) Shaken, not stirred. Spilled it all over my p*ssy. (groans) Mmm, that\\'s good. Booze and coffee is a good combination. I am feeling amped right now, I am feeling hype. So this is the part in the video where I should admit that I\\'m not just a casual observer here. At the time I\\'m making this video, sweaty, I\\'m super canceled. I try to make videos that are both informative and entertaining. So in this video the information is you get to learn about cancel culture and the entertainment is you get to watch a worm try to wriggle off a hook. (tongue pops) Let\\'s get started. Forgive me father, for I have sinner, hey, how are you? God, I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber who would resort to making videos about my own drama but things have gotten to a point, I feel like I can not continue this channel until I spill some tea. So let\\'s get started. Okay first, a little backstory, a little mise en scene. I\\'ve never talked about this on my channel before so this is a super f*cking vulnerable moment for me but I am, in fact, a transgender woman, which may come as a big shock to many of you since I\\'m 100% real fish. (tapping) I get comments all the time from like very solemn people like, \"Guys, I\\'m pretty sure this is a dude.\" Okay, you\\'re a detective, you\\'ve cracked the case. You\\'re doing very good, sweetie, very, very good. But yes, as one of YouTube\\'s leading B-list transgenders, I am a prime target for cancellation and I have been canceled many, many times. And we\\'re gonna talk about some of the things I\\'ve been canceled for and some of the things I\\'ve been criticized for and the difference between criticism and canceling, because yes, there is a difference. As we go along, I will admit where I have made mistakes because despite how I look, I am not a literal goddess and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due. However, where I believe that criticism of me is excessive or unwarranted, I will not apologize, because here at ContraPoints Industries, we are not in the business of serving bullsh*t. So, the reason for my current cancellation is, in summary, that in my last video Opulence, I cast transsexual p*rn star Buck Angel in the role of John Waters. And yes, it\\'s a much better story than the hair vitamin debacle. So notify the drama channels, put in a good word for me, because sweetie, I\\'m not here to make friends, I\\'m here to win. So basically I\\'m canceled for collaborating with Buck Angel and a lot of trans people think Buck Angel is a horrible person. And so my collaboration with Buck Angel is evidence that I too am a horrible person. Cancel culture trope six, the transitive property of cancellation. Cancellation is infectious. If you associate with a canceled person, the cancellation rubs off. It\\'s like gonorrhea, except doxycycline won\\'t save you this time, sweetie. Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all, on whether Buck Angel is in fact a horrible person. So who is Buck Angel? Well, he\\'s a trans man of my parents\\' generation. He grew up in a world where there was not anything like the visibility and access to information about transition we have today, and where there is a strict medical gate keeping system in place for people who wanted to transition. In fact, Buck was the first female to male patient his doctor had ever treated. In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer, his gimmick at the time being the man with a p*ssy. But he also became an activist. He wanted to create more positive trans representation within the p*rn world, and from there, he became a more general educator and advocate for trans people. I first heard about him in the early 2010s when I was doing some googling about some little gender issues I was having myself, although I ended up deciding to remain a female. And Buck was one of the first female-to-male people I\\'d ever heard about. And he made an impact on me in part because you take one look at him and you think honey, that\\'s a man. But he was born a woman. (ominous music) You can do that? So it\\'s not that he inspired me to transition or anything, it\\'s just it was one of many moments along my whole entire gender journey. So I had positive feelings about Tranpa, that\\'s what he calls himself, from back then, and then a few months ago when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised over another time I was being canceled by trans Twitter, we\\'ll get to that one later, I saw this post from Buck on Instagram. \"Dear beautiful human being, I see your pain. \"It is okay that you lash out at me. \"You do this because I am you \"and you are reflecting your self hate to me. \"I am strong and will be here \"for you forever and no matter what. \"This is my intention as a human being, to help others.\" \"Love, Buck Angel.\" And then the caption, \"Suffering, that is why \"the trans community lashes out at each other. \"I am very aware of the hate towards me \"by some in the community. \"They hate on me and others because they are hurt.\" And those were exactly the words I needed to hear at that moment so I commented a heart and then Buck DMed me and he said, \"I love you.\" And I was like senpai noticed me, and so I said I love you back. Then when I was working on Opulence, I needed a voice actor to do a line from John Waters\\'s book. And it was my co-director, Theryn, who suggested, \"Don\\'t you think Buck Angel sounds kind \"of like John Waters?\" And I said, \"Well, he just messaged me on Insta, \"let\\'s see if he wants to do it.\" And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel as John Waters in the video credits. Like a trans icon playing a gay icon. In my head it was just so, well, iconic. So I got in touch with Buck about the line and he was like yeah, I\\'d love to do it. So here it is, the 10 second voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life. - \"One must remember, there is such a thing \"as good bad taste and bad bad taste. \"to understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.\" - That\\'s it, children, that\\'s why mommy\\'s canceled. Now I was aware at the time that trans Twitter hated Buck Angel. But my thinking was well, trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity and they certainly hate me so I wasn\\'t gonna let that stop me. Little did I know quite how vicious things were about to get. Now, so far, I\\'ve been telling this story from my point of view but I do want to give a fair and balanced account. So I want to pause and contextualize why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much, they\\'re willing to cancel anyone who even associates with him. Basically, it all goes back to this old debate in the trans community known today in Tumblr lingo as truscum versus transtrenders. So truscum are trans people who distinguish between true trans people and fake trans people who they call trenders or tucutes. Usually truscum think that what it is to be trans is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria, to pursue a medical transition involving hormones and surgery, and to socially re-assimilate into your target binary gender, so male or female. Anyone who is not that, according to truscum, must either be a confused teenager, someone just trying to get attention, someone mistaking their trauma or their fetish for being trans, in a word, a trender. So that\\'s a vish of transness that usually excludes non-binary people as well as people who don\\'t want to medically transition for whatever reason, and for that reason, this view is sometimes also called trans medicalism, truscum obviously being the derogatory term for these people. So truscum are very hated by a lot of trans people because their viewpoint is that not all trans identities are valid. And Buck Angel is widely perceived to be truscum. So the next question to ask is, is this true, is Buck Angel, in fact, truscum? Now my honest answer to that question is, I don\\'t know. He certainly said some things that sound like things truscum say, I\\'ll give you that. A point he likes to make a lot is that he\\'s transsexual not transgender. And the difference between those terms is sometimes defined as transsexual implies that you want to pursue medical transition, so hormones and surgery, and transgender doesn\\'t imply that. And people associate this, \"I\\'m transsexual, \"not transgender\" thing with truscum because truscum often call themselves transsexuals and say that anyone who isn\\'t a transsexual isn\\'t really trans. And often those people will be very mean to people they call trenders, especially certain transmedicalist YouTubers like Vanessa LeBlanc and 2CuteSmasher9000. (laughs) 2CuteSmasher9000. Roast me back, Calvin, I dare you. (laughing) (dinging) But I think it\\'s important to keep in mind that the term truscum is a product of the 2014 Tumblr wars, and trying to apply it to trans people of an older generation can sometimes be misleading. Like when Buck Angel transitioned, the word transsexual was just the word for his identity and he still identifies that way. So when younger trans people tell him it\\'s wrong to use the word transsexual, he feels like these ungrateful Millennials are invalidating his identity. And I do understand where he\\'s coming from with that, but I also understand why a lot of non-binary people are skeptical about Buck. Like he says again and again, \"I\\'m transsexual, \"not transgender, like don\\'t mix me up with those people.\" And that eagerness to separate himself from transgender people, it comes across as hostility. Like I don\\'t think he\\'s ever actually said that non-binary people aren\\'t valid but I personally don\\'t like that he seems like he wants to distance himself from them. And that\\'s my disagreement with Buck, it\\'s not that he invalidates non-binary identities because I don\\'t really see him doing that, and if he was doing that, I would have seen it, because for the last two months a lot of people have been doing nothing but sending me problematic Buck Angel tweets. But as someone who cares a lot about non-binary people and who loves the non-binary people in my life, it does upset me when he does this distancing thing and I hope he listens to this criticism because I think it would be cool if he got better about this. Of course, Buck is technically right that there are different kinds of trans people. And I agree it\\'s important that we can make those distinctions and talk about the differences when they\\'re relevant. But I also think that as a community, trans people benefit from unity not division. Like if you have an employer who discriminates against trans people, they\\'re not gonna care if you\\'re transsexual, transgender, non-binary or gender non-conforming. They\\'re gonna discriminate against you regardless. So we\\'re all in this together and there\\'s a lot of disagreements among us and we often don\\'t get along so well, but politically I think we should work together as much as possible instead of splitting into little factions because we share most of the same interests and I think the best way to do that is to build bridges instead of burning them. And that\\'s why I\\'m willing to work with people like Buck Angel who I have some disagreements with. It creates a connection, you know. And having that connection can lead to communication and build understanding. Also I need all the connections I can get, gorg, I am very lonely. (sad violin music) It\\'s not a joke, it\\'s true. Now I get that some people have views that are so harmful that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous. But in any case, I didn\\'t even give Buck a platform to share his opinions, I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator. A bunch of people on my sub-Reddit were like why couldn\\'t she just get John Waters to do those lines? Well first of all, I don\\'t actually know John but I just have a feeling he would write me off as some kind of (beep) millennial SJW. Like why is Buck Angel canceled but John Waters isn\\'t? Well, because trans Twitter does not know who John Waters is and let\\'s try to keep it that way. I actually mentioned this to a friend of mine who knows John and he told me that he and John have actually watched Buck Angel\\'s p*rn together. So plot twist. (sinister music) Okay, so trans Twitter won\\'t forgive me unless I condemn Buck Angel as truscum and apologize for ever working with him. But I\\'m not going to do that because I don\\'t think it would be the right thing to do, and doing it just to get myself uncanceled would be cowardly. I\\'m happy to tell you I absolutely disagree with Buck\\'s divisive rhetoric about transsexual versus transgender. I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender umbrella instead of trying to distance himself from the rest. And I\\'m happy to hear at the perspective of non-binary people who don\\'t trust him because I totally got where they\\'re coming from and I think that\\'s valid. But I also respect the decades of good activism Buck Angel has done for trans people and I am grateful to him for that. And in light of that, I\\'m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt about where his heart is and express my criticism in a more measured way than just attacking who he is as a person. But Twitter needs to establish that he\\'s a horrible person because this is the strategy they\\'ve chosen to establish that I am a horrible person. And if the truscum allegation isn\\'t strong enough to prove it, oh, they have other pieces of evidence to fall back on to hold up their conclusion. For example, here\\'s a tweet claiming, \"Natalie\\'s trying so f*cking hard to make it sound like \"the only thing Buck Angel ever did was write \"a few iffy tweets, and that\\'s just \"so f*cking far from the truth. \"Dude launched a targeted tabloid harassment campaign, \"outing a trans woman against her will, \"with a specific intent of causing her physical, \"emotional and professional harm. \"The shorter way of saying that is \"that he wanted to make her suffer \"and she very well could have been killed.\" Yikes, this ain\\'t it chief. Friendly reminder that this isn\\'t a good look. Maybe don\\'t try to get trans women killed? Disappointing. It sounds pretty serious, let\\'s investigate. (quirky mystery music) Here\\'s what I\\'ve managed to piece together. Scene one, the year is 2003, Los Angeles, where the movie world, the p*rn world and the BDSM scene come together in a tale of heartbreak, betrayal and transsexualism, La La Land. Dramatis personae, Buck Angel, transsexual p*rn star. Ilsa Strix, dominatrix then wife of Buck Angel. Lana Wachowski, wildly successful director of The Matrix, at the time, not yet out as a transgender woman. The synopsis is that Ilsa Strix and Buck Angel\\'s marriage ended after Ilsa had an affair with Lana Wachowski who was not yet out as trans. So Buck was understandably upset about the affair and, in what seems like a petty act of revenge, told a series of magazines that this celebrity director Wachowski was a cross dresser who had stolen his wife which, I guess, was the information he had at the time. So is that outing a trans woman against her will? Well, in retrospect it seems like it though that may not be what he thought he was doing at the time. But to really get to the bottom of this, we have to do some digging. We have to trawl through the dirty details of trans people\\'s personal histories, which I\\'ve noticed is one of the Internet\\'s favorite activities. So I actually went on eBay and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991, January 2006, and I\\'m finally able to reveal (drum rolling and intense music) that the seller canceled the order. Goddammit. But I was finally able to track down and translate a Spanish version of the Rolling Stone article from the Wayback Machine, and I\\'m finally able to expose the truth. Stop, freeze exactly where you are. Take a look at yourself and what all of us have been doing for the last 30 seconds. Who does this behavior remind you of? If your answer is social justice advocates fighting for trans equality, you are incorrect. If your answer is creepy stalkers who hate trans people... (bell ringing) I am very suspicious of anyone who\\'s online behavior prompts me to dig through articles full of dead names and sordid scandals involving trans people from almost two decades ago. This is very similar to techniques used against trans people by internet fascists. So I\\'m pretty suspicious of anyone pushing this kind of investigation. How can you tell the difference between a trans-anarcho socialist with an anime avatar and a Nazi pretending to be a trans-anarcho socialist with an anime avatar? Well, you can\\'t. Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous, whether it\\'s on 4chan or Twitter. So unless Buck Angel, Ilsa Strix or Lana Wachowski gets in touch with me and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason they want me to publicly dig up their 17-year old divorce drama this is none of my f*cking business. And it\\'s none of yours either. So shut up and go back to Kiwi Farms where you belong. (pleasant ballroom music) (slurping) Let\\'s Irish up this tea. Doesn\\'t work as well with tea. So setting aside any tabloid drama that may have happened during the Bush administration... (laughing) I\\'m saying this is in the cuntiest way, and they deserve it. They f*cking deserve the cuntiness. I\\'m spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bath robe. I\\'m a lady. she\\'s a woman. (coughs) (pop music) The main argument against me usually references a collage of Buck Angel\\'s problematic tweets. And this is supposed to be definitive evidence that he is a horrible person, and therefore, that I am a horrible person for collaborating with him. Well, here\\'s the thing though, a collage of problematic tweets does not define a person. And I\\'m very used to being defined that way myself. So I know how unfair it can be. Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel, a lot of people on Twitter were already calling me truscum, that\\'s been going on a year and a half now. And any time my name comes up on Twitter, a bunch of people respond saying, \"Natalie is truscum, \"Natalie\\'s a trans medicalist, \"Natalie hates non-binary people \"and you should really think what kind \"of message you\\'re sending to your trans \"and non-binary followers by platforming her.\" And if the person defends me or argues back in any way, they, \"say I can\\'t believe you\\'re ignoring \"the valid concerns of marginalized people.\" You know, they\\'re weaponizing their marginalized status as trans people to isolate and attack another trans person. And sometimes this stuff gets to my head too. I start asking myself wait, am I a trans-medicalist? Do I really believe all these awful things they say I believe? But the answer is no, I just don\\'t. These things they\\'re saying about me are 100% not true. You know, \"believe marginalized people\" is a norm that has encouraged in leftist spaces for good reason, much like \"believe victims\" or \"believe women.\" And these norms were established to counterbalance the mainstream tendency which is not to listen to marginalize people or to victims or to women. But any norm can be abused, and the blunt fact of the matter is sometimes marginalized people are wrong. Sometimes people calling themselves victims are obscuring a more complicated situation. And it\\'s even happened, once or twice, that a woman has lied. And the accusation that I\\'m truscum is simply false. I mean first of all, I don\\'t even think of my own transgenderism as a medical disorder, much less everyone else\\'s. I have of course collaborated with Dr. Spiegel et al. But I will not have my artistry reduced to mere medicine. (upbeat pop music) Second, this accusation that I hate non-binary people is just no. Non, non. My thinking about trans identity has always been informed by non-binary people. I used to identify as non-binary myself before I medically transitioned, and some of the closest people to me in my life today are non-binary trans people, some of whom are also transsexuals, incidentally, (laughs) it\\'s complicated. I\\'ve also made at least five videos on this channel arguing for the validity of non-binary gender identities, going back more than three years. So that\\'s five out of around 50 videos, or 10% of the content I\\'ve made on this channel is about non-binary identity. A few months ago I even made a 30-minute video called Transtrenders, which uses character dialogue to show what I think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism. But there\\'s still hundreds of people on Twitter saying that I\\'m truscum who hates non-binary people. And their main piece of evidence for that is a collage of my problematic tweets. So let\\'s take a look at that. Here\\'s the three tweets that I usually see scrap-booked together as definitive proof that I hate non-binary people. This is the first one from September, 2018. Notice how it\\'s taken out of context from the thread so you can\\'t even see what I\\'m talking about. \"I\\'m sure this is not the experience of many NBs.\" NB means non-binary people. \"I leave it to them to articulate \"what NB existence looks like in a binary world. \"I do not and I can not speak for them. \"But surely\", god, I used to write like such a nerd, \"But surely an account that begins and ends \"with, I\\'m not a man because I don\\'t identify \"as one, is pretty weak.\" Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread that that tweet has been clipped out of, I was defending myself from accusations that my most recent video, at the time, The Aesthetic, was anti non-binary. In that video there\\'s a character named Justine who defends a version of the performativity theory of gender. And basically I made this video to express some angst I was feeling about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye. This was a very one-year-on-hormones moment for me and I\\'ve already moved on in my thinking. At that time I was very... My behavior must (quirky music) be perfectly feminine at all times or else I\\'m not really a woman, my self-esteem is totally based on sleeping with heterosexual men who resemble my father. (buzzing) And anyone who knows anything about trans women knows that most of us go through a stage like this at some point. And some YouTubers never get out of it. (tongue pops) But personally, I mean these days, it doesn\\'t matter what I wear, (sad violin music) it\\'s when I dream these dreams... (laughs) Dragging \"The Danish Girl\". Well f*ck the Danish, I could never abide that sort of person. We all know what I\\'m talking about. You can tell the whisky is getting to me because I\\'m being bigoted against the Danish. These things come out, you know? (cups clinking) When, you get honest, you get real when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system. Did I just f*cking put lipstick outside the f*cking lip liner? This is all Lily\\'s fault. Lili Elbe, f*ck her dreams. The point is when I was making the aesthetic, I wasn\\'t even thinking about non-binary people. And people will say that the fact that not every video I make references non-binary people is itself NB-phobic. As I\\'ve, said about one in 10 of my videos is about non-binary identity but not all of them are and I feel entitled to make some videos that are just about trans women. But still some people on Twitter were saying that the character Justine is a transmedicalist. And because she maybe wins the fictional debate in the video, I Natalie Wynn, am therefore a transmedicalist. Here\\'s the thing though, the performativity theory of gender, the one that Justine defends in that video, is conceptually as far away from transmedicalism as it is possible to be. Transmedicalism says that trans identity is biological, it\\'s neurological, it\\'s hormonal, its diagnosable and treatable, whereas performativity says that gender is gesture, it\\'s expression, it\\'s performance, it\\'s a social phenomenon. Phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon. Performativity makes no reference to gender dysphoria or to any kind of medical concept at all. So whereas transmedicalism is a kind of bioessentialism, performativity is a kind of social constructionism. So these are exact opposite theories of gender. Are you following along class? I\\'m not. (laughs) I\\'m ready to drink Jameson Tea until I die. But some trans people felt invalidated by things Justine says in that video. And transmedicalism is another thing that makes them feel invalidated. So they decided that Justine is a transmedicalist and therefore that I am a transmedicalist. And this is literally just bad media comprehension. Like, it\\'s a failure to plausibly interpret a video that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult. And so much of the negative response to that video is just pure emotion. I always hear, \"I don\\'t care what you intended, \"trans people were hurt by that video. \"You hurt trans people.\" But here\\'s the thing, just because you were hurt by content I made, doesn\\'t mean that the content is bad or that I\\'m victimizing you in some way. I\\'ll give an example. I did a stream a couple years ago with a BDSM and kink activist. We were talking about various kinks and we got to DDLG which is daddy dom, little girl, basically when consenting adults role play age difference and the power dynamic that comes with that. And me and this kink activists were just casually discussing what DDLG is, what it isn\\'t, when I noticed someone in the chat was starting to totally freak out. They were typing in all caps like my abuser used DDLG to justify raping me, why are you defending my abuser? I can\\'t believe you\\'d betray me like this. Please stop taking my abuser\\'s side, please stop, I\\'m begging you. This was actually really f*cking upsetting to me because this person was clearly in a lot of pain. They were having a panic attack because they were having a trauma trigger reaction to this conversation. And I kept telling them to leave the stream and take care of themselves but they wouldn\\'t do it. So I had to block them and then later get in touch and make sure they were okay. Now was there pain very real? Yes. Was it triggered by the content I was streaming? Yes. But does that mean I did anything wrong? No. Is it wrong to talk about kink in context where it\\'s clear you\\'re going to be talking about kink? No. But when you produce content online that\\'s going to be viewed by thousands or millions of people, there\\'s always some people out there who are going to be hurt by it. So if you want to argue that a tweet or a video I made is somehow immoral, I think you need more of an argument than just, \"People were hurt.\" All right, back to the tweet. To this day, people quote tweet the sentence, \"But surely an account that begins \"and ends with I\\'m not a man because I don\\'t identify \"as one is pretty weak.\" And they claim this as evidence that I\\'m truscum or that I think people have to prove their identities somehow, which is not at all what I was saying in that thread. What I was saying is if you\\'re trying to persuade a skeptic that trans identity is valid, simply saying I\\'m not a man because I don\\'t identify as one isn\\'t a very good argument. Which it isn\\'t. I mean, no one has ever been persuaded by that, so far as I\\'m aware. That said, I do now disagree with the mindset I had when I tweeted this. Back then I still delusionally believed that it was possible to rationally explain why trans identity is valid. And I was simply looking for a more persuasive argument than, \"This is how I identify, you have to believe me, \"no further questions.\" But I no longer believe there can be any rational justification of gender identity. Which is another reason I\\'m not a transmedicalist. Transmedicalism tries to be a rational theory about why trans identity is valid, and I don\\'t think it succeeds as that, I don\\'t think anything does. My current opinion about this is that, \"I\\'m not a man \"because I don\\'t identify as one\" is as good, or rather, as bad, an argument as any. You know, some things in life just can\\'t be rationally explained. Like love. Why do you love the person you love? Well, because you love them. You could write a poem about it or some gay sh*t like that, but you can\\'t give any actual arguments. And why am I a woman? (upbeat pop music) Because I\\'m a woman. That\\'s it. I mean, I can describe my experiences and my feelings to you to help you understand better but I can\\'t logically prove anything. And I\\'m super f*ckin sorry if you can\\'t handle that mankind was set adrift in an absurd world. That must be super f*cking hard for you. Tell me all about it. (bell rings) Next please. Okay, again we\\'re mid thread with missing context but the tweet says, \"Whereas I\\'ve met 20 year olds \"in full-on boy mode who are like hi, \"I\\'m a trans woman, she-her pronouns.\" So I guess by including this tweet in the ContraPoints is problematic collage, people are implying that I don\\'t think it\\'s valid for someone who presents male to identify as a woman and requests she-her pronouns. Well, that\\'s not true. I was surprised when I first experienced this but I think it\\'s valid, next. (bell rings) Okay, mid thread, no context once again. \"But now you go into these leftist discord/Facebook groups \"and like 20 to 30% identify as some flavor of trans, \"most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals. \"That seems to be the future.\" Okay well, it\\'s true that many leftist discord servers are like this. But reading this back, I don\\'t like the way the phrase, \"conventional binary transsexuals\" is hitting my ear. I can see how it could imply that non-binary identities are somehow newfangled, which isn\\'t true. There\\'s been non-binary people for longer than there\\'s been medical transsexuals, in fact. So we\\'ll call this a bad tweet. I apologize for tweeting it and I apologize to any non-binary people who felt trivialized by it. (bell rings) Okay, this is the big one. This tweet got its own article in the f*cking Guardian. You know, I really wish people would pay less attention to the tweets I spend 30 seconds writing, and a little more attention to the videos that I spend, you know, hundreds of hours making. (sighs) Anyway, let\\'s look at the tweet. This is the most scrutinized paragraph I\\'ve ever written and it\\'s so mediocre. \"This has happened to me before in hyper woke spaces. \"Like it\\'s me and a bunch of cis women \"and we all have to go in a circle saying \\'she/her\\' \"because I\\'m there. \"There\\'s this paradox where I can go \"to a sports bar in North Carolina \"and be miss-ma\\'amed all night, no question. \"But in self-consciously trans inclusive spaces, \"I have to explain my pronouns \"and watch woke people awkwardly correct \"themselves every time they say you guys. \"I guess it\\'s good for people who use they-them only \"and want only gender-neutral language, \"but it comes at the minor expense of semi-passible transes \"like me, and that\\'s super f*cking hard for us.\" So people interpreted this tweet as me being against the practice of sharing pronouns, which I\\'m literally just not. Like I\\'ve actually been the person who initiates the pronoun circle many times. The backstory of this tweet is basically that I once got triggered in a situation where I was with a bunch of cis women and we all had to go around saying our pronouns. And like a typical triggered (beep), I tiptoed over to Twitter, to tip-top-type it out. But here\\'s the thing, by the end of this thread, I had already talked myself away from the initial frustration I was expressing. If you know my videos and my voice, then you know me saying, \"It comes at the minor expense \"of semi passible transes, and that\\'s super f*cking hard \"for us\", is sarcastic. It\\'s a minor expense. It\\'s not actually very hard for us, gorg, it\\'s fine. (sighs) But people on Twitter don\\'t watch my videos and they don\\'t get sarcasm. So people flipped out over this. I was getting dragged and I made the poor decision to try to solve the tweet problem with more tweeting, which 100% of the time is like trying to put out a fire with lighter fluid. So me and my dumb brain did another short thread, trying to clarify what I was saying and defending my right to talk about my own experiences. That didn\\'t make things any better so in a state of anger and frustration, I tweeted out yet another thread and this time I said some truly stupid things, including the now-infamous line, \"I sometimes feel like the last of \"the old-school transsexuals.\" I honestly don\\'t know what the f*ck I was even trying to say. \"I don\\'t feel like the last of the old-school transsexuals,\" I don\\'t even know what that means. I guess I basically meant that, offline, I don\\'t have any radical aspirations. I want to be inconspicuous, I want to blend in. And that\\'s what I meant by \"old school,\" I want people to assume my pronouns. It\\'s funny because it is very different from the way I am online where I\\'m totally shameless and open. I\\'m like sexual confession everybody, sexual confession, I have abnormal urges! (siren blaring) It\\'s 1:00 a.m. My neighbors can definitely hear that. They know I have abnormal urges now. They already knew that. But offline, I\\'m an inconspicuous p*ssy, like a total coward. So this was a rage thread and I apologize for tweeting it. (bell chimes) (muffled pop music) (slurping) Let\\'s go back to Buck Angel. (sighs) I\\'m kind of a conscientious objector to the practice of condemning someone based on a collage of their worst tweets taken out of context, but I definitely do have anxiety about this. Like, I think I\\'m doing the right thing by not condemning Buck as truscum and evil but, I mean, I could be wrong. What if I am basically sacrificing myself for the sake of a person who really is as bad as Twitter says. Maybe tomorrow he\\'ll tweet f*ck non-binary people and then I\\'ll have f*cked up. (sighs) This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me. But I do believe that by refusing to participate in the anti-Buck Angel pile on, I am erring on the morally safer side of things. Because even if he is a little truscummy, excommunicating him from the trans community is still probably not the best approach to take. In my experience, when people accept binary but not non-binary trans people, it usually takes like a 30-minute conversation to win them over to some level of non-binary acceptance. And I\\'ll give you a couple examples. The first time I was ever canceled, like totally trashed on Twitter, was back in 2017, when I had not yet medically transitioned, and at the time, I identified as non-binary. And at VidCon 2017, I met up with a YouTuber named June who had made some videos where she basically mocked the idea of non-binary people. And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June, and some other people but let\\'s keep them out of it, and people on Twitter totally dragged me for being a peak liberal boot licker who\\'s best friends with transphobic abusers. Christ, these f*cking people, man. This is so f*cking frustrating. And I\\'m not gonna claim I changed June\\'s mind because I don\\'t know what her thought process was but I did talk to her about non-binary identity and she did remove her anti non-binary videos. And I don\\'t have any regrets about that brunch. (slurping) (glass shatters) (man screams) Example two, a couple months later, I did a livestream with a conservative trans woman YouTuber named um, what was her name? Sharon, Sharon, was it Sharon? I guess she\\'s just not a very memorable person. Anyway, she had made some videos saying that non-binary identities aren\\'t real. But I gave her a chance and she surprised me by being super compassionate and thoughtful. By the end of that stream, she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity. So again, the point is not that I\\'m some kind of persuasive genius. If I was a persuasive genius, maybe I could talk myself out of being canceled. The point is that sometimes people who seem ignorant or hateful just need to be given a non-judgmental space to learn and grow and think. And to just condemn them as hopeless bigots actually prevents that growth from happening. And Sharon, despite her totally forgettable personality, turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person. Like later on she actually made an apology video to non-binary people and I became good friends with her and we work together on most of the videos I\\'ve made this year. You know, until she ruined my life by recommending a canceled John Waters impersonator. I guess the moral is never talk to people you disagree with, it will only lead to pain. (gentle acoustic music) I do think there\\'s something off with my hormone dose, like I\\'m crying three times a day. Oh, and I can\\'t cum unless there\\'s vibrators in at least three of my holes. It happens like once a month, there has to be a full moon. I honestly only still bother because it numbs the pain for a few moments. What I\\'m trying to say is I really do believe in conversation which means hearing out multiple perspectives. I don\\'t want my audience to get all their information about trans people from me, and I think it\\'s important to listen to criticism. So I encourage my audience to go watch some non-binary YouTubers who have criticized me and criticized Buck Angel. For example, go check out non-binary YouTuber, Luxanders\\'s video about me and non-binary YouTuber, Korviday\\'s video about Buck Angel. I think YouTube as a platform is better at producing criticism rather than canceling. And I think that\\'s because, at least in the vlog format, making a video forces you to confront the fact that you\\'re a human being with a face and a name, who can be held accountable for the things that you say. But people on Twitter, it\\'s a different story. And I think it\\'s time we take a look at what canceling really is. I\\'ve given you enough context now for you to understand what I\\'m about to show you, which is what I saw on my timeline every day for nearly a month. All these tweets are from the aftermath of my uploading Opulence, two months ago, when the Buck Angel scandal first broke. And so I\\'m gonna hold my hands now because this gets ugly. (gong rings) (laughs) \"Hey, if any of you still support ContraPoints \"after her bigging up and collaborating \"with notable TERF favorite and truscum, Buck Angel, \"you\\'re no friend to gender nonconforming, \"non-passing and non-binary trans people. \"F*ck her and f*ck her f*cking grift. \"I am absolutely furious right now. \"Weird how I\\'m 30 and trans and managed not \"to be a truscum, maybe I\\'m just some kind of anomaly, \"or maybe ContraPoints is a conniving rat-f*cking kapo \"who could do with a fully wound backhand to the mouth. \"Since I\\'m out of Twitter jail for now, \"I just want to say f*ck ContraPoints, \"her sycophantic stans and all her BreadTube chums \"who closed ranks to protect her after she throws \"the rest of the trans community under the bus for profit. \"Natalie Wynn is a f*cking grifter. \"ContraPoints videos are now just style over substance \"so that explains why she took to TERF ideology so well. \"ContraPoints working with truscum \"now definitively proves \"that pretty much everyone defending ContraPoints \"just hates NBs and are also truscum, \"legit gonna start on following peeps \"that continue to follow ContraPoints at this point. \"Do note my wording of pretty much everyone. \"I know there are some that were probably blindsided \"by this somehow. \"So long as you know that ContraPoints is truscum, \"you\\'re safe and cool. \"Eat sh*t, Natalie. \"For someone who used to identify as gender-queer, \"we expected more from you. \"But I guess when your heads \"this far up your own ass, it\\'s hard to consider others. \"ContraPoints, more like disappoints.\" Oh, that\\'s a good one. If you\\'re gonna drag me, at least be funny. \"F*ck Buck Angel, f*ck ContraPoints, \"f*ck any real transsexual. \"F*ck your grift. \"Here\\'s what hashtag ContraPoints stans don\\'t understand. \"If Natalie refuses to accept that she has an apology \"to make and continues profiting from it, \"it will become our responsibility \"to work on de-platforming her, \"just like every other racist, sexist, \"bigoted content creator. \"No one has actually suggested or attempted \"to actually cancel her, but the longer \"this goes on without an apology \"and commitment to be better, the stronger \"the case becomes for actively working to de-platform her.\" So in other words, no one has suggested we cancel her but we should cancel her, great. \"Can everyone finally agree \"that ContraPoints belongs directly inside a garbage can.\" Here I am, sweetie. \"ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck...\" Angel Buck, thanks for letting us all know that you had no idea who he even was until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about. \"ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck, \"a transmedicalist who once outed a trans person \"to try and destroy them, and supporting him \"because he looks and sounds like a proper man isn\\'t \"a small itty bitty, tipsy topsy f*cking mistake. \"This is a huge deal. \"ContraPoints could be literally collaborated with Hitler.\" (bell chimes) We have a Hitler comparison. \"Could be literally collaborating with Hitler today \"and y\\'all would be like oh well, \"she\\'s just a little flawed, you know? \"F*ck off.\" \"Can Natalie Wynn stop being a coward \"and commit to being a trans-med, \"it\\'s really tiring to watch this happen every week. \"Natalie Wynn is a spoiled brat who refuses \"to take accountability. \"Anyone who supports Natalie Wynn \"does not support non-binary people. \"Natalie Wynn is such a terrible person, my god. \"Every cis and not non-binary person \"who thought Natalie win wasn\\'t trans-med now owes me \"and every non-binary person $50. \"Joe Biden has a better position on \"the validity of non-binary gender than ContraPoints. \"My opinion is that ContraPoints really sucks \"a lot and I don\\'t like her. \"I hate ContraPoints so goddamn much, it\\'s unbelievable. \"ContraPoints be like let\\'s hate some non-binary people!\" (laughs) This is a very good impression of me. You\\'re doing very good, sweetie. You\\'re doing very, very good. \"Buck Angel is a TERF apologizer, \"boot licker and truscum. \"Any association with him must be seen as hostile \"to the trans community as a whole, \"let alone denial of non-binary existence. \"That\\'s the line in the sand, folks where do you stand? \"And here we f*cking are dude, \"Buck-f*cking-Angel on ContraPoints. \"Eat my entire ass!\" What, what? (laughing) \"This is Natalie, Natalie is a transmedicalist, \"this is Natalie\\'s friend Lindsey, Lindsey is a lefttuber. \"Natalie and Lindsey are still friends \"because Natalie and Lindsey are both cowards. \"Lefttube is a grift.\" Oh, and they made me the man. The shade! \"Issues that arose with (mumbles) being \"in Contra\\'s new video. \"Her video on turfs make no sense now. \"Her video on transtrenders make no sense now.\" You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel totally contradicts the videos I spent hundreds of hours making, do you think maybe your interpretation could be wrong? Apparently not. \"Her apology is completely void, \"sends a message that she hates non-binary people. \"She is reckless with her content. \"Positive set arose from Buck Angel being \"in Contra\\'s new video, \"she has $400,000 this month from Patreon.\" 400,000, this number is completely made-up. It is exponentially wrong. $400,000, $400,000 a month. \"Odd take, ContraPoints is the leftist PewDiePie. \"Personally, I like to characterize her as \"the Blair White Wolf in leftist sheep\\'s clothing. \"Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece \"of sh*t who still has not apologized \"for platforming truscum and is actively taking their side. \"Anyway, if you still support ContraPoints, \"get the hell away from me! \"Pee pee, poo poo, I\\'m ContraPoints \"and I can\\'t stop being a transmedicalist \"and sh*tting myself in public huh.\" (moans) Valid criticisms of marginalized people. (laughs) \"F*ck ContraPoints, f*ck truscum. \"ContraPoints is a truscum. \"ContraPoints is a truscum. \"ContraPoints is a truscum. (clapping) \"ContraPoints is a truscum. \"ContraPoints is a truscum. You know, when you repeat the same f*cking sentence over and over again, you don\\'t need to repeat the same sentence over and over again... (beeps) Actually doesn\\'t get more persuasive, in fact, it might get less persuasive because true things usually only had to be said once. (tongue pops) \"If you still support ContraPoints, \"unfollow me immediately and never interact with me again. \"In conclusion, f*ck Natalie Wynn \"and f*ck everything she has to say.\" (sighs) (somber acoustic music) Okay, let\\'s get started. So that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets. And all of this, let me remind you, is over a 10-second voice-over clip in a 48 minute video about a completely unrelated topic. How do you work, how do you create, when a decision so trivial can become the main event for weeks of your life? And the tweets are just the beginning. After that there\\'s the Reddit threads and the YouTube comments AND the Facebook discourse AND the Medium posts, and the Newsweek article. Opulence is a video me and Theryn spent hundreds of hours carefully piecing together. I think it\\'s my best video. And to have the response to it completely overwhelmed by one minor casting decision is heartbreaking and infuriating to me. And it\\'s left me with much less energy to create new things. But here\\'s the thing, people on Twitter saying mean things about me is not the worst of it, not even close. Like I\\'m a politically opinionated trans woman who publicly transitioned while making anti-fascist content on a notoriously right-wing platform. (laughs) Sweaty, I am so used to reading mean things about myself online, most of you probably can\\'t even begin to imagine how used to it I am. And the way you psychologically survive in that situation is you block the people on platforms who are harassing you and you pay it no mind. But there\\'s some things you can\\'t block. And a big one is you can\\'t block people from going after your friends and colleagues. And that is exactly what people did to me at the height of the Buck Angel incident. Lindsay Ellis, Olly from Philosophy Tube and Hbomberguy all got inundated with tweets demanding that they publicly disown me, a person they\\'ve all been friends with for years or else. In response to demands that she apologize, Lindsay released a statement where she said, \"I was not involved in Opulence. \"My name was mentioned in it, \"but I did not participate in the production. \"Therefore, with regards to calls for me to apologize, \"I have to ask, apologize for what? \"There is only one logical answer, \"apologize for being friends with Natalie.\" And here\\'s a response to her statement. \"I don\\'t need to consider you my f*cking friend \"to disagree with beliefs you knowingly solicit \"or allow on your platform. \"Same with Contra, it just means you\\'re willing \"to allow awful ideas to fester for the sake \"of financial gain which is fine, \"but it makes you a piece of sh*t.\" And here\\'s a comment at Hbomberguy. \"I doubt that you were gonna read this, \"but can you please just tell us your thoughts on \"that whole situation so we could at least know \"that you are on our side. \"We don\\'t want to have to cancel all of y\\'all \"and cause BreadTube to go into a schism \"as a result of this, thank you.\" Nice YouTube channel you (sad violin music) have there, friend. Would be a shame of someone canceled it. (laughs) So f*cking sinister. Olly of Philosophy Tube released his own statement affirming his support of non-binary people, but adding, \"Sadly I\\'ve also been harassed, threatened, \"doxxed, had my private life speculated on \"and my loved ones insulted, \"in recognizing the feelings of those who kindly raised \"their concerns in a polite way, \"I do not wish to legitimize the great many people \"who use their hurt as a cover \"for unacceptable toxic and abusive behavior.\" And here are some responses to Olly, \"As a non-binary fan of yours, \"I\\'m disappointed in this non-apology.\" Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for? Ever having associated with me? \"Things we are going to criticize Olly Philosophy Tube for, \"being a sniveling hypocritical piece of sh*t, \"refusing to listen to trans people, \"actively, openly and repeatedly mocking \"the trans people he refuses to listen to. \"Thanks for the apology, now stop endorsing ContraPoints.\" Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing is demanding that cis people publicly condemn a trans woman for loosely associating with another trans person. Does that strike anyone else as wildly inappropriate? Even Mia Mulder, a trans woman who has never publicly associated with me got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Olly, you know, after he made the post discussing being doxxed and threatened. And just for that, she gets put on the enemy list. \"I\\'m sad to say that Mia is on the list \"of people that have stood by ContraPoints \"as she had continued to be a bigoted piece of sh*t.\" To which Mia responds, \"Stood by ContraPoints, Jesus Christ. \"No matter what I do, people call me out \"and I\\'m not even related to the video \"and I don\\'t even know Natalie!\" The chain of guilt by association is so long and twisted, I can barely even follow it. So they\\'re going after Mia, (quirky mystery music) who tweeted a heart at Olly, who failed to condemn me for my voice-over casting of Buck Angel, who was retweeted by a TERF. We\\'re only missing a couple of degrees of separation before every living person on the planet Earth is canceled over the Buck Angel situation. And several colleagues of mine, by the way, Lindsay, Harry, Olly, they all took a financial hit over this. They\\'ve all lost some Patreon support. One of the Lindsay\\'s former supporters even demanded a $38 lifetime refund saying, \"Dear Lindsay, I\\'m sorry for being pushy, \"but I really am going to be needing a refund. \"I gave money to your operation under the pretense \"that you wouldn\\'t do anything morally objectionable \"and supporting ContraPoints and blaming us \"for taking issue with that is, \"in my opinion, amoral. \"Please respond.\" I hope she sent it to them in pennies. So look, I\\'m very grateful to my colleagues for sticking by me through all this, but I\\'m also aware that I\\'m becoming a burden to anyone who associates with me. I have no collaborators in this video. I\\'m working on this totally alone because I\\'m aware of how radioactive I am right now, and I don\\'t want to contaminate anyone else. During the height of this most recent canceling, a creator I admire DMd me to let me know, \"I cut the shout-out to you in my last video \"because I was nervous to draw the ire of your detractors, \"who are getting genuinely scary. \"But I wouldn\\'t want you to think I was disavowing you, \"regardless of how many people are asking me to.\" Jesus Christ. The situation here is that any cis person who defends me, or even associates with me in any way, will be labeled a transphobe. Any binary trans person who associates with me will be branded an NB-phobe. And any non-binary people who associate with me will be ostracized from their own community. So on the Internet I find myself increasingly alone. I\\'m isolated by the harassment. And that is ultimately the point, to exile me from my community, from any community. And it\\'s all because I refuse to participate in doing exactly that to Buck Angel. My experiences have made me so disillusioned with the idea that social media call-outs can lead to any kind of justice, that I\\'ve essentially sworn off participating in them. There\\'s a fairly prominent figure in leftist politics who I could absolutely hashtag-Me-Too, but I\\'m never gonna do it because I have no faith left in the process of call out vigilante justice. And I\\'m not saying I\\'m totally against Me-Tooing people, because I think, in some cases, it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do. But in my case, I feel like I just know too much about the dark side of social media shaming to ever want to participate in it again. You know, I feel like the story would end up being taken out of my control, warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways. It would end up just haunting both me and the person I\\'d be accusing which, in this case, honestly, neither of us deserves. So I\\'m just not willing to take that risk, except maybe in some very extreme situation which this just isn\\'t, it\\'s not worth it. And likewise, when a mob is at my doorstep demanding I condemn Buck Angel to save myself from cancellation, no! I\\'m just not gonna do that. I\\'m a conscientious objector. I\\'m willing to go to Twitter jail for this. Take me away, boys. (somber piano music) (groans) If there\\'s one thing I can\\'t stand it\\'s BreadTube videos. \"Part eight and a half, \"the philosophy of being f*cked in the ass.\" (groans) I have done this to YouTube and I\\'m sorry. So look, canceling is not criticism. It is not holding someone accountable. It is an attack on a human being. In this video I used the word \"canceling\" more or less synonymously with what feminist, Jo Freeman, author of the \"Bitch Manifesto\". calls trashing. And I\\'ve linked her essay, Trashing: The Dark Side of Sisterhood, in the description. It was originally published in Ms Magazine in 1976, but it is a perfect description of what goes on on trans Twitter today. \"It is not disagreement, it is not conflict, \"it is not opposition. \"These are perfectly ordinary phenomena which, \"when engaged in mutually, honestly and not excessively, \"are necessary to keep an organism \"or organization healthy and active. \"Trashing is a particularly vicious form \"of character assassination which amounts \"to psychological rape. \"It is manipulative, dishonest and excessive. \"It is occasionally disguised by the rhetoric \"of honest conflict, or covered up by denying \"that any disapproval exists at all. \"But it is not done to expose disagreements \"or resolve differences. \"It is done to disparage and destroy. \"Whatever methods are used, trashing involves \"a violation of one\\'s integrity, \"a declaration of one\\'s worthlessness, \"and an impugning of one\\'s motives. \"In effect, what is attacked is not one\\'s actions, \"or one\\'s ideas but one\\'s self.\" And that\\'s what distinguishes trashing, bullying or abuse from criticism or holding accountable. Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs. But when people are canceling me, they\\'re not bringing up my problematic tweets because they want me to revise my beliefs. No, what they\\'re doing is accumulating evidence to support the case they\\'ve decided to make that I am a horrible person who must be shunned. The only sense in which I am, as they like to say, the new Blair White, is that I think I actually have now snatched Vanessa\\'s crown as the most hated tran on tran Twitter. (laughs) Vanessa, I\\'m trying to feud with you. Feud with me, goddamnit. You can\\'t have a one-sided feud. I don\\'t want to be one of those trans YouTubers that just drags other trans people all day and they never respond. That would be really pathetic. The new Laci Green, that\\'s the other one. The newest in a series of women you\\'ve decided to treat like supervillains. Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hmm? And supervillain is the right word, like I\\'m the bad guy. Duh, I\\'m the enemy. And what do you do with the enemy? Well, you disavow, disown, deplatform and destroy. As that one tweet put it, \"That\\'s the line in \"the sand, folks, where do you stand?\" If you adequately demonstrate your searing hatred of Natalie Wynn, then, \"You\\'re safe and cool.\" But if you don\\'t you\\'re on the wrong side of the line, sweaty, and you two are now the enemy. Cancel culture trope seven, dualism. Certain ancient religions teach their followers to understand the cosmos as a struggle between light and dark, good and evil. And cancel culture does it more or less the same thing. It\\'s binary thinking, people are either good or they\\'re bad. And to add to that essentialism, if a person says or does a bad thing, we should interpret that as the mask slipping, as a momentary glimpse of their essential wickedness. And anyone who wants to remain good had better be willing to publicly condemn anyone the community has decided is bad. There really is something dystopian about this, you have to be willing to accuse other people to prove your own innocence. \"That\\'s the line in the sand, folks, where do you stand?\" In the most extreme version of this, all bad people are equally bad. So collaborating with truscum means you may as well be a truscum. And, of course, being truscum is tantamount to being a TERF, and on trans Twitter, it is a known fact that TERFs are Nazis. And this implies that Nazis, TERFs, truscum, people who associate with truscum, people who fail to condemn people who associate with truscum, people who offer emotional support to people who fail to condemn people who associate with truscum, all of them must be treated the same way. \"Deplatform her just like every other racist, \"sexist, bigoted content creator. \"A fully wound backhand to the mouth.\" I recently read a book by Sarah Schulman called \"Conflict is Not Abuse: Overstating Harm, Community Responsibility and the Duty of Repair\". Basically Schulman\\'s argument is that, in various contexts from romantic relationships to community infighting to international politics, the overstatement of harm is used as a justification for cruelty and for escalating conflict. So for example, and this is my example, not Schulman\\'s, TERFs fixate on the exaggerated danger that trans women supposedly pose to cis women. And in very classic overstatement of harm, they\\'ll describe everything they don\\'t like as rape. Trans women entering women\\'s spaces is rape. Trans women existing, Janice Raymond, is rape. And then they use that exaggerated harm as a justification to retaliate against them, to dox, and harass, and shun. Well the same kind of logic is used to justify abusive behavior within the trans community. The dualistic thinking, the essentialism, the pseudo-moralism. All of this allows people on Twitter to treat me in an obviously abusive way, all the while feeling like they\\'re doing the right thing because they\\'re attacking the enemy. And I realize that some people will say that I\\'m the one who\\'s overstating harm to evade criticism. Well look, you\\'ve seen the tweets, the furious demands for me to be exiled, the doxxing and threatening and ordering around of my colleagues, the attempts to isolate me from my community, the attacks not on my actions but on who I am as a person. There\\'s not really anything ambiguous about this, it\\'s just abuse. But I don\\'t think it feels like abuse to the people who are doing it. They feel like they\\'re punching up because I\\'m a celebrity with a platform and lots of Twitter followers. And it\\'s true that I do have more power than any of them individually. But as a collective, they have a terrifying power that they don\\'t seem to be aware of as individuals. As Jon Ronson, author of a great book on public shaming put it, \"I suppose that when shamings are delivered \"like remotely administers drone strikes nobody needs \"to think about how ferocious our collective power might be. \"The snowflake never needs \"to feel responsible for the avalanche.\" And that\\'s how you get these situations where you have hundreds of people endlessly bashing someone who\\'s already been knocked to the ground, and feeling all the while like they\\'re punching up. You know, there\\'s actually a kind of power in safety and anonymity and obscurity. And there are many ways that being a public figure makes you really vulnerable. For example, you\\'re more vulnerable to doxxing, stalking and harassment on a scale that most people probably can\\'t even imagine. You\\'re vulnerable to having your reputation permanently degraded in a way that people who are posting anonymously, or pseudonymously, are pretty much invulnerable to. And a lot of the people who are attacking me, they\\'re not pausing to self-reflect, they\\'re not holding themselves accountable for the consequences of their actions. They\\'re just venting their unfiltered rage. But in response to these attacks, I, as a powerful person with a platform, I\\'m not allowed to react like a human being. I\\'m not allowed to get angry. I\\'m not allowed to show pain. I\\'m not allowed to get defensive, I\\'m not allowed to lash out. All I\\'m allowed to do is go totally numb on the inside as I try to frantically calculate the ideal public relations response that pays due deference to the valid concerns of these poor marginalized people, all the while ignoring the tsunami of verbal abuse that\\'s crashing over me. People on Twitter, they don\\'t try to persuade me like I\\'m a human being. They order me around, they tell me what to believe, they demand that I say exactly what they want me to say, or else. It\\'s extremely objectifying. They don\\'t treat me like a person with my own opinions and feelings. They treat me as this brand of moral commodity to be consumed or denounced. And this is all terribly ironic because of the conflicting demand that creators be authentic all the time. One thing that always frustrates me about these situations is there\\'s this demand that you apologize instantly. And there\\'s this perception that a fast apology is more sincere than a delayed one. But in fact, the opposite is true. It takes longer than a couple hours to cool down, lower your defenses, listen, learn, grow, seriously reflect on what you may have done or said that was wrong. That can take days or weeks or months. I had to do my October AMA stream for Patreon, and at the beginning of the stream, I gave my emotional half-formed reaction to the Buck Angel situation. And some traitor on my Patreon (scoffs) transcribed that part of the stream and disseminated it on Twitter, just to instigate another round of canceling. You\\'re not allowed a chance to think or feel. And because supposedly the best thing to do from a PR perspective is to apologize immediately, canceling produces a lot of insincere bullsh*t apologies from people who haven\\'t, in fact, learned anything. And I think most people are aware of that. In fact, I think the demand for an apology itself is often insincere. If you\\'re being canceled, rather than criticized, the line in the sand has been drawn. You and all your kin have been declared the enemy. Apologize to Twitter. At this point, I may as well apologize to 4chan. Dear 4chan, (upbeat music) I am super f*cking sorry I called you thin-wristed otaku sh*t weasels who like looking at pictures of little girls. I have been trying to educate myself and learn from my mistakes, and I now realize that\\'s only 70% of you. Once you\\'re canceled, (sad piano music) you can really do no right. If you apologize, the apology will be declared a manipulative attempt to save face. And in fact, it will be used as further evidence of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are. If you try to explain or defend yourself, I mean, first of all, you will almost certainly dig yourself in deeper. But even if you\\'re articulate and correct, you\\'ll still be seen as unable to take criticism, and as ignoring the hurt of marginalized people. And if you just goes silent, you\\'ll be seen as a coward fleeing accountability, even though there\\'s lots of reasons why you might go silent. Maybe you\\'re taking a few days away from social media to try to cool down and think clearly. Or maybe you\\'re so overwhelmed by the harassment that you\\'ve just shut down. (upbeat trumpet music) Let\\'s do shots. Who wants to do a shot with me? Do you want to do a shot with me? Let\\'s do a shot. (cork popping) The tequila shot is my favorite, I like the whole salt tequila-lime ritual. It\\'s just very satisfying to me. That\\'s the end of that bottle, okay. Let\\'s get started. (slurping) You feel warm right away, you know that feeling where it\\'s like oh, hey, how are you, happiness? Hey how are you, feeling that life is worth living? It\\'s a good moment. You\\'re like oh, this is okay, this is gonna be okay. I can get through this. That\\'s how it starts, you have to watch out for that. So look, I really don\\'t like to represent myself as a victim. That\\'s not really a narrative that I identify with. But for the purposes of communicating what effect canceling has, I feel like I should say something about the pain. Much of the happiness that you might expect to come along with success has been taken away from me by this constant fury that surrounds me. Try to think about this rationally. I\\'m a Libra Sun Pisces Moon. (twinkling) Being canceled is hell for me. I want to be liked by everyone. And I\\'m starting to think I might be in the wrong career for that. (laughs) In a way, leftist Twitter finally accomplished what 4chan, Nazis, stalkers and TERFs have been trying and failing to do to me for years. They\\'ve made Twitter into a platform so hostile to my existence that I\\'ve decided to leave it forever. And they demoralized me to the point I could barely get out of bed for a month. And I know (sad violin music) that sounds really melodramatic but I\\'m just trying to be honest with you about what a melodramatic person I am. I find I have trouble convincing people of the severity of the pain that being canceled causes because I think it\\'s just hard to imagine if you haven\\'t been through it yourself. And I don\\'t know a more succinct way to convey it to you than by telling you that, in the last few years I\\'ve been harassed by Nazis, I\\'ve been harassed by TERFs, I\\'ve been stalked, I\\'ve been doxxed, I\\'ve been threatened, I\\'ve been sexually assaulted. And the pain of being canceled, of being totally trashed by other trans people online for years has been more difficult for me to cope with than all the rest of it combined. Jo Freeman actually describes how I feel better than I think I can describe it myself. \"I was one of the first in the country, \"perhaps the first in Chicago, \"to have my character, my commitment, \"and my very self attacked in such a way by Movement women \"that it left me torn and little pieces \"and unable to function. \"It took me years to recover, and even today, \"the wounds have not entirely healed. \"This attack is accomplished by making you feel \"that your very existence is inimical to the movement, \"and that nothing can change this short of ceasing to exist. \"These feelings are reinforced when you are isolated \"from your friends as they become convinced \"that their association with you is similarly inimical \"to the movement and to themselves. \"Any support of you will taint them. \"Eventually all your colleagues join in in \"a chorus of condemnation which can not be silenced, \"and you are reduced to a mere parody \"of your previous self.\" Yeah, that just about sums it up. Now, as it happens, I am going to survive this because I have very deliberately built a support network that will be there for me regardless of what online trans communities say. And I have very deliberately done that because early in my transition back in 2017, I relied very heavily on the online leftist trans community for all kinds of emotional support. You know, when you\\'re early in transition, I mean it just sucks. You feel like the whole world is against you. And I talked about this a little bit in my last video, feeling like a freak show walking down the street. And even if you\\'re lucky enough to have a supportive family, usually it still is gonna take them a while to come around. At first they don\\'t got it, they say things to you like, \"Aren\\'t you worried you\\'ll regret this?\" And like, they struggle with your name and pronouns, which is understandable, but at the same time, it makes you feel like you\\'re not being seen for who you are. So you need a kind of second family that understands how you\\'re feeling and acts happy about your transition, and validates your gender. And for the first couple months of my transition, I found that in this world of online transgender leftism. Well that didn\\'t last long because well, I was what, two months into my transition when first I did an interview with the Journal Is Jesse Singal, and then I agreed to do a debate with Theryn and Vanessa. So that\\'s a long story but in short, I associated with a string of people that trans Twitter considers the enemy. And trans Twitter tore me apart over this and it completely broke my heart because I was really leaning on, basically, emotional support from strangers online. Which seems really stupid in retrospect. And after they turned against me I decided, one, that I was never going to rely on this group of people again and, two, that I was going to have to find acceptance elsewhere. And in retrospect, I think this actually may have been good for me in a roundabout way because I was kicked out of the safe space and I dropped that mentality. And so basically I was thrown into the deep end of reality and forced to sink or swim. And I don\\'t know if my transition or my channel would be where they are today if it hadn\\'t been for that trial by fire. Are we swimming through fire or are we mixing metaphors? The point is I\\'m more armored against canceling than I was two years ago. And the reason why is I have acquired a certain level of privilege and security and independence from any one community. So that if one community cancels me, I still have somewhere else to go. The people who are most vulnerable to cancel culture are not white guy comedians, they\\'re not James Charles, they\\'re not me, they are marginalized people who feel like they have nowhere else to go when they\\'re rejected by their community. That means struggling trans people with a few hundred Twitter followers, it means a lot of sex workers, it means people who totally rely on activist circles for emotional and material support. I\\'ll quote Jo Freeman one more time. \"I had survived my youth because I had never given anyone \"or any group the right to judge me. \"That right I had reserved to myself. \"But the movement had seduced me \"by its sweet promise of sisterhood. \"It claimed to provide a haven from \"the ravages of a sexist society, \"a place where one would be understood. \"It was my very need for feminism and feminists \"that made me vulnerable. \"I gave the movement the right to judge me \"because I trusted it. \"And when it judged me worthless, I accepted that judgment.\" There\\'s a really irritating point that people on the Left like to make that goes, \"Well, \"canceling doesn\\'t really end anyone\\'s career. \"Canceled people usually get a new job or keep their platform \"so I guess it\\'s not really that bad, huh?\" I think people say this because they\\'re trying to mitigate any sense of guilt they might feel about how they\\'re treating people. Because it\\'s a really stupid argument. There\\'s lots of things that don\\'t end your life that are still terrible. But also, there\\'s cases where canceling has ended someone\\'s life. On December 5th, 2017, a p*rn star named August Ames killed herself by hanging in a public park after being canceled on Twitter over a homophobic tweet. On December 3rd she tweeted, \"Whichever lady performer is replacing me tomorrow \"for Erotica X News, you\\'re shooting with \"a guy who has shot gay p*rn, just to let you know. \"BS is all I can say\", shrug. \"Do agents really not care about who they\\'re representing? \"LA Direct, I do my homework for my body.\" So I\\'ve never worked in p*rn so I can\\'t really tell you what the norms are around women working with men who have done gay p*rn. But the tweet certainly sounds homophobic to me and that seems to be the consensus of other industry people on Twitter. So Twitter did its thing, people in August\\'s community called her a homophobe and lashed out at her. And as always happens, plenty of passers-by jumped in to throw tomatoes at the woman in the stocks. Over the next few days, August tweeted several more times going through the usual stages that you go through when you\\'re being canceled. First, she defended herself. She claimed most other women in the industry feel the same as her. Then she said she\\'s bisexual and therefore she couldn\\'t be homophobic. Then she said fine, I\\'ll guess I\\'ll be fake and not have opinions then. Then she started bemoaning how mean twitter is and she got really defensive about her right to choose who she has sex with, and she latched out of the people attacking her. And then, in her final tweet, she just said, \"F*ck y\\'all.\" And went to the park that night and killed herself. This is all so familiar to me, I feel like I\\'m able to relive with her each stage of this emotional process. There\\'s that first moment when you realize the outrage is beginning and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach, and then the anger, feeling misunderstood, and then the bargaining, the fear, and finally the shame and the despair. And here\\'s the thing, I totally agree with her critics that her tweet was bad. Of course she has the right to say no for any reason, but she publicly expressed this in a homophobic way. But she was still a person who deserves to live. And I think there\\'s got to be a better way to deal with these situations than just trashing someone until they kill themselves. And I know it\\'s never as simple as Twitter made her kill herself, there\\'s always other things going on in the background. But the point I\\'m making is canceling is more dangerous to marginalized people because marginalized people generally have more things going on in the background. John Watson did an investigative podcast about her death, and it goes into how she was sexually abused as a child, abandoned by her father. She was living with a boyfriend she was kind of emotionally detached from. And a few weeks earlier she\\'d filmed a scene with a guy who was unnecessarily rough and mean and who mistreated her, so she was kind of traumatized by that and so she was kind of on edge and really defensive about who she worked with when she was tweeting. Then the backlash happened and since she had no other support network, she probably felt like the only community she had turned against her. And that\\'s a really painful feeling. She must have felt so despised. Which is how I have felt for the last two months. I feel despised and burdensome. And I can imagine how a person who feels that way could have an impulsive couple hours where they think their best option is suicide. I mean, I can more than imagine it because I\\'ve been there myself. And I\\'m still here, because at those moments, I\\'ve been with good friends who took care of me. And by friends I do mean Xanax. (laughs) (banging) But I\\'ve also survived because there\\'s a lot of people on the internet who\\'d be very entertained if I killed myself and I simply refuse to give them the satisfaction. Oh no bitch, I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite. I mean, who needs a guardian angel when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas on the fumes of total contempt? What I\\'m really trying to say is Merry Christmas, you goddamn assholes! (\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\") (crashes) ♪ Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining ♪ ♪ Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow ♪ I need to get my lesbian pliers out again. (cork pops) (\"Silent Night\") Have a super f*cking happy new year, gorg. How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment? Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub? Leave a comment if you want a bathtub. All right, I need to take a deep breath because, let\\'s be honest, I\\'ve got one crack away from attacking my own Twitter followers with an umbrella. I am about one breakdown away from going on a rampage and making a suit out of women\\'s skin. Just kidding, I would never do that. Though, on a bad skin day, I\\'ve given it serious consideration. Oh, I\\'ll be fine. I\\'ve gotta sober up anyway because I\\'m having more plastic surgery in a couple days. And plastic surgery, that\\'s about the only thing holding me together at this point. (laughing) YouTubing, this is a healthy profession, this is great! Anyone want my job, step right up. All you have to do is make informative and entertaining videos about extremely controversial topics while of course representing the full range of experiences in the LGBTQIAA-plus spectrum and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny. Well go on, I\\'m waiting to be entertained. Feed me mother. Oh don\\'t mind me, I\\'ll just sit back and pour another glass of wine. Oh, and I will, of course, be obsessively scrutinizing every word you say for any hint of moral transgression, as well as critiquing your look, ya third-rate crossdresser. Zero out of 10, get off my stage. You successfully spilled that everywhere, it\\'s good. (bell rings) (sighs) I do still want to talk about why people cancel and the effect that it\\'s having but it looks like there\\'s gonna have to be a part two, gorg, because I have hit my limit. So why don\\'t we all cut our losses and try again in 2020, hmm? I realize that people on Twitter aren\\'t actually gonna watch this video, they\\'re just gonna make fun of the title and how long it is, which fair enough, but they\\'re the ones whose accusations against me are so numerous and convoluted, it required a feature-length film to respond to. But yeah, they\\'re gonna see the title and they\\'re gonna transcribe quotes out of context and they\\'re gonna say I\\'m a fascist, I\\'m a TERF, I\\'m truscum, I\\'m the new Blaire White, I\\'m the new Laci Green. I\\'m a cis bootlicker, I\\'m an enlightened centrist. I\\'m a sh*t-Lib, I\\'m alt-right. I\\'m a heartless grifter raking in millions of dollars over the bodies of dead trans women. \"Mask off, yikes, this ain\\'t it chief. \"Friendly reminder that this isn\\'t a good look. \"Maybe don\\'t be a cis bootlicker? Disappointing.\" But they\\'re saying all those things already so I\\'m inoculated. See, their mistake was completely breaking my spirit, they should have left a little piece intact. But it\\'s good, it\\'s good, it\\'s good, because basically my survival from here on out hinges on my ability to not care at all what people say about me online. So here\\'s to not giving a f*ck. (Auld Lang Syne) - [Man] Happy new year, everybody! - This is almost a Norma Desmond cosplay. Which is good, because I\\'m not gonna age gracefully and it\\'s the best to get into character now. YouTube stars never die. (tongue pops)',\n",
       " 5: ' (\"Ach wie flüchtig, ach wie nichtig\") - Oh, hey, gorg. Hey, how are you, gorg? Okay, listen. I know this looks bad, I know you think I\\'m bougie and you\\'re here to take me to the guillotine. Well, fair enough, but before you do, can a dying queen make one request? How about this, I\\'m the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off, but first, you have to let me tell you my life story. Fair? That\\'s super f*cking great. Now, sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself. I\\'ll start at the beginning. My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss. I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C., where the most exciting attraction for children is the National Museum of Natural History. At least, it\\'s the most exciting attraction for nerdy children, who, I might I add, deserve their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children. Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don\\'t get me wrong, I liked a good stegosaurus as much as the next five-year-old, but my real passion was the Gem and Mineral Hall. Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer! It inspired me to start my own little gem collection. I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade. The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up for my sixth grade teacher, Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public. F*ck you, Romano! I\\'m glad your father died! Comrades, losers, and haters, I would like to propose that aesthetic sensibility, whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion, or music, begins with absolute pleasure. You rotate the crystal in your hand and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light. Your nape hair stands on end and a tingle goes down your spine. Yes, God! But as you get older, things get more complicated. Northern Virginia is McMansion country, and while my family lived in a more modest colonial, I remember riding around in the back of the minivan, looking at some stylistically jumbled monstrosities, and I would get excited by some little detail, like, say, a circle of fake battlements atop a misplaced tower. But then my mom would say, \"Look at this ostentatious trash!\" So you learn, you learn taste according to the social class of your upbringing. And with taste comes all this adult baggage, snobbery and pretense and conceit. So I don\\'t know what you\\'ve heard from my accusers, but I assure you, I have nothing to do with taste. I am but a simple queen longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems. So, stripey-sock cat girls of the heckin\\' Revolutionary Committee, before you pass sentence, allow me to make my case, gorg. (\"Ach wie flüchtig, ach wie nichtig\") One, Success. Oh, hey, how are you, gorg? Look, I like stuff. I like shiny things. For me, there really is still a simple childlike pleasure to it all. But the adult reality is opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle. There\\'s a social context for it. It generally means something. Why does Donald Trump\\'s apartment look like Liberace married a Turkmenistani dictator and moved into a Cheesecake Factory? Well, because he\\'s trying to send a message, maybe to the world, maybe to himself. He\\'s saying, \"Behold, I am a winner, \"a very stable genius with one of the highest IQs.\" Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power, from the pharaohs of Egypt to the kings of France, to even the humble servants of the world\\'s major religions. I guess God likes shiny things too. In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success. It is the trophy by which you show the world that you achieved the American dream. The plot line of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches. In the words of Drake: ♪ Started from the bottom, now we\\'re here ♪ ♪ Started from the bottom, now the whole team\\'s f*ckin here ♪ Opulence is the aesthetic display that you\\'re here. You\\'ve made it. You\\'re rich, bitch. Remember in high school, when you had to read \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott SparkNotes? The character Jay Gatsby doesn\\'t even like opulent mansion parties, but he throws them anyway just to show his crush, Daisy, that he\\'s made it, that he\\'s a success, that he\\'s worth something. And as we all remember, in the end, they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to save the hall of Hrothgar. At least, that\\'s what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay about how the theme of \"The Great Gatsby\" is money always leads to happiness. I got a D minus! ♪ I like dollars, I like diamonds ♪ ♪ I like money, I like shining ♪ ♪ I like those Balenciagas, f*ck ♪ I\\'m sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms and driving Lams and all that sh*t, but teacher, pick me, pick me. Let\\'s talk about symbols, let\\'s talk about allegory. Let\\'s talk about metaphor, let\\'s talk about themes. Fellow students, let us place the text in historical context. Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper to making money moves. That\\'s the American dream. Hip hop opulence isn\\'t just gratuitous glitz and hedonism. It\\'s a celebration of success for people who often come from backgrounds where that kind of success is really improbable. Don\\'t you think it\\'s kinda weird that conservatives still say, \"Rap music is the reason \"for the problems with the blacks.\" For conservatives, the American dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty, and is there any sector of our culture where the American dream is more unironically celebrated than hip hop? It\\'s not just hip hop, though. Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture. You can\\'t even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci and the Ferraris, and the Fendi and the Bugattis, and the Armani and the Maseratis. Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullsh*t, which, to be clear, I\\'m completely in favor of. Burn down the Statue of Liberty for all I f*cking care, and replace it with a large-scale figure of Donatella Versace holding a bottle of Cristal. That\\'s at least a more honest representation of our culture than the hypocritical cheese verse currently inscribed on Liberty Island. I guess Cristal\\'s French, isn\\'t it? Well, no one really drinks Italian booze. We have standards in this country. Listen up, America. We live in a society, a society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams, not of climbers, but of graspers. To paraphrase Ian Danskin, maybe anyone can achieve the American dream, but everyone cannot. And the fact of the matter is most people don\\'t. I mean, what would it even mean to be rich unless someone else was poor? I mean, who\\'s gonna polish your golden toilet? Not other rich people, that\\'s for sure. So when you live in a society that constantly equates wealth and success, but which is also so unequal that most people will never be wealthy, well, what\\'s the average person supposed to do? Two, Fantasy. (sighs) I wish the world were my gem collection. I wish I owned everything. I\\'m really just the worst kind of phillistine, you know? I go to an art museum and it\\'s like, Monet, Rembrandt, okay, that\\'s super f*cking great, but can I buy it? Well, no, I can\\'t buy it. The grim reality is you can\\'t own everything. So what do you do? Well, you fake it. You create an illusion. I don\\'t own this building. Any rube off the streets of Baltimore can walk in here, as indeed, you did. But that\\'s okay, I need a witness. I need you to see me here among the other art, where I belong. Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know? It makes me feel valuable. You know, you don\\'t actually need wealth to be opulent because opulence is not abundance. Opulence is the aesthetic of abundance. It is the aesthetic of owning everything. The phrase, \"Opulence, you own everything,\" is, at this point, basically a gay internet meme. - Apalence! ♪ Apalen, apalen, apalen, apalen ♪ - But it originally comes from the documentary, \"Paris Is Burning,\" about the Harlem ballroom culture in the 1980s, where it\\'s proclaimed by emcee Junior LeBeija. - O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E, Opulence! You own everything! - It\\'s not a celebration of a real lifestyle of luxury and decadence. In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says of the queer black and Latin-American participants of the balls: - You know, a lot of those kids that are in the balls, they don\\'t have two of nothing. Some of them don\\'t even eat. - So ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamor, an illusion created by skillful artifice. Participants walk categories, like executive realness, with the goal of being indistinguishable from a real executive. Nowadays, every white queer says the word realness, I guess in kind of a frivolous way. I mean, whomst among us honestly hasn\\'t slipped into a dissociative fugue state, dressed up as a clown, kidnapped a few neighborhood children, and told the cops, \"I\\'m giving you John Wayne Gacy realness, hunty?\" I did it, officer, I did the cultural appropriation. I am a colonizer. I am part of the problem, and I\\'m sorry. Take me away, boys! That\\'s crazy, that\\'s mega coconuts. I guess I should explain that American slang works according to what we might call a trickle-up model of linguistics. All the new words are invented by the most marginalized gay and trans people of color. Then, those words trickle up to straight black people and white gays, and then finally, white cishets start using them. A lot of times, the original meaning or context gets lost along the way. So originally, realness, as Shon Faye put it: - [Shon] Was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume, but a tragic comic disguise of the chasm between what is being emulated and what is absent, namely, racial justice, class equality, and safety. - Realness, in that sense, is a much more complicated and interesting concept than the generic trans notion of passing. Passing is just looking like a five-two, happy, baby, bouncy biogirl. Whereas, in the ballroom sense, realness has a subtext of defying injustice. You\\'re using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle that has been unjustly kept beyond your reach. - You\\'re not really an executive, but you\\'re looking like an executive. And therefore, you\\'re showing the straight world that I can be an executive. If I had the opportunity, I could be one, because I can look like one. - I think one reason there\\'s been a surge of interest in \\'80s ballroom culture, such as the FX drama Pose, which is set during the era, is that it dramatizes an essential truth about America. It\\'s really important to people in this country to at least sometimes feel like they\\'re living a luxe life, even if, in fact, they aren\\'t. Las Vegas is essentially an entire city that exploits that need. Vegas hotels, like the Venetian, the Bellagio, and Caesar\\'s Palace, are designed to make you feel like a fancy bitch, even though they\\'re actually just high-rise traps designed to lure you in and take your money. And if there\\'s one thing I can\\'t stand, (inhales deeply) it\\'s traps. (playful music) But the trap works because part of what it is to be American is to want to feel like a fancy bitch. I actually love Vegas. I was there last year for the only good YouTuber, Lindsay Ellis\\'s bachelorette party. I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn\\'t tempted to gamble. But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-40s, I did once experience the first exciting stages of a gambling habit. I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity, and had some good luck playing blackjack. I mean, I wasn\\'t a high roller or anything, but my first time, I walked out with an extra $200, and that was a lot of money to me. At the time, I was working a customer service job making $10 an hour, so to make $200 in five minutes, that\\'s worth 20 hours of soul-crushing customer service toil, before taxes. So I went back and I went back, but I never got lucky again, and fortunately, that was enough to discourage me. I remember one time, as I was leaving the casino, I saw this man standing outside with this look on his face that I have never seen on a human being before or since, just absolute shock, despair, this deep shame and self-disgust, the kind of face that says, \"I\\'m gonna have to explain to my wife \"that I spent the kids\\' college savings \"on a high-limit slot machine.\" And there is nothing opulent about that, nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs with IV drips trying to pay off their hospital bills. America, we are a bad country. Donald Trump is a Vegas man. He\\'s pulling this grift on the entire country, and it keeps working because the fantasy opulence of the American dream is more enchanting to the imagination than any abstract mathematics of economic equality. So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell, but in fact, there are two very different types of magic at work. For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex, a demonstration of their wealth and power. But for the marginalized and impoverished, opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and power they\\'ve been denied. The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function, it\\'s like the difference between a viper and a butterfly serving viper realness. Three, Class. HEY, how are you? Hey, HOW are you? Hey, how ARE you? Hey, how are YOU? (sighs) People don\\'t understand how difficult it is to be this blonde! You know, a biological female that looks like me, I\\'m afraid some transvestite psycho is gonna sneak in through a rear window, and I\\'ll have to dial M for murder! I get vertigo just thinking about it. I\\'ve always felt the Marxist analysis of class difficult to apply to the present day. As a typical modern woman, it\\'s just super f*cking hard for me to relate to sk-sk-sk and I oop and I oop and I oop. That\\'s praxis. Like, bourgeoisie and proletariat, whomst? Who is she? Where is her summer collection? That\\'s super f*cking great, but can I buy it? Marx\\'s typical examples are a factory owner and a factory worker. Now, I could be out of touch, but personally, I\\'ve never met a factory worker, or a factory owner, for that matter. They must all be on a brand trip to China, working on the B&P summer collection. What\\'s supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles is that the bougies own the means of production, and the proles work for wages. But what about a bartender who owns the bar she works in? What about YouTubers? Which side of the revolution are we on? I\\'m just trying to figure out where I stand here, \\'cause if the revolution starts on Twitter, my head is definitely going in the basket, and then I\\'ll have no choice but to do the conservative talk show circuit, you know, like most people whose brains are detached from their bodies. Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong, hey, how are you? I feel like a class analysis with only two classes must be overly simplistic. My favorite book about class in America is Paul Fussell\\'s \"Class: A Guide Through the American Status System,\" which describes nine distinct classes. Fussell is not as concerned with economic relations between classes as he is with status, what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital, things like education, style, taste, and attitude towards money. Now, the book was published in 1983, so a lot of the references and details are out of date, but there\\'s an eerie familiarity to a lot of the core observations. And it\\'s also just pretty funny, like his quasi-scientific observation that the higher your social class, the smaller the balls in the sports you play, or his description of middle-class living rooms. - [Paul] \"Your real middle class refuses to show \"any but the most bland books and magazines \"on its coffee tables. \"Otherwise, expressions of opinion, awkward questions, \"or even ideas might result.\" - One of Fussell\\'s core themes is that it\\'s not how much money you have that defines your class, so much as how you got your money. If you had to work for your money, then you\\'re not really upper class. The upper class has inherited wealth, and as a result, they\\'re very confident. They don\\'t feel the need to prove themselves. Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted their position on the ladder. But then there\\'s the middle class, who are social climbers, and who compensate for their insecurities by, for example, placing a pretentious collage of university bumper stickers on the back of the family car. This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote. - [Lord Melbourne] \"The higher and lower classes, \"there\\'s some good in them, but the middle classes \"are all affectation and conceit, \"and pretense and concealment.\" - Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated by people with something to prove, whether it\\'s marginalized ballroom performers proving their worth to themselves, or the new rich building McMansions to show off their wealth to others. So there\\'s something kind of odd about Donald Trump. He inherited his wealth so he should know better than to have golden faucets, but he doesn\\'t. As Fran Lebowitz said, \"He\\'s a poor person\\'s idea of a rich person.\" And that\\'s actually his charm, it\\'s part of his mass appeal. Trump behaves like a prole who won the lottery. So there\\'s actually something kind of relatable, un-snobbish, and even pseudo-democratic about the golden faucets. People who have wealth, but not class, are actually very popular in this country. We don\\'t like class here because class is exclusionary. Whereas anyone can acquire wealth, we tell ourselves, so wealth feels potentially inclusive of everyone, even though in practice, it isn\\'t. Now, the upper class cultural elite in this country, the real classy people, are mostly very unlike Trump. Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy, they embrace the reserved old-money values of aristocratic WASPSs: White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. Fussell notes, for instance, that they tend to value privacy over showing off. They like to live at the end of long driveways in houses away from public view. They dress down while traveling so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves. These are essentially survival skills of the experienced rich. If you flaunt your wealth too much, people might rob you, or they might get envious and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines, or worse, taxation. (dramatic tense pounding) Old money knows this, but new money just cannot resist the temptation to show off. I actually wonder if the old WASPy upper class is dying out. I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory of money over class. His presidency validates the idea that you can be as vulgar as you want, so long as you have the cash to back it up. So the old class system is dying out, and in its place, we have universally adopted the mindset of the nouveau riche. If you\\'ve got it, flaunt it. If you haven\\'t got it, find a way to flaunt it anyway. Now, I\\'m sure this is all very tragic and disappointing to people of class and taste, but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur, it\\'s actually fantastic news. Four, Taste. Listen, comrades, I\\'ve been pretty down on opulence so far, and I could continue analyzing it in terms of inequality and class struggle, but you already know all that. That\\'s why you came to cut my head off. But hold on, is that really all there is to aesthetics, Marxist economic analysis, or the SJW version that makes everything about race and gender? As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said: - But remember that it\\'s both possible, and even necessary, to simultaneously enjoy media while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects. - So what about the enjoyment part? Surely, you wouldn\\'t behead a queen just for liking shiny things. Is there no room for art for art\\'s sake? The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen, Fraulein Immanuel Hildegard Marlene Kennedy Davenport-Kant, said that purse aesthetic taste is disinterested. That is, completely free of any material desire. Of course, Miss Thing also founded the #NoFap movement, so I don\\'t know how seriously we want to take of that. But it\\'s actually kind of similar to what Plato said about aesthetic sense, that it merely begins with a desire for the bodies of beautiful boys, which is really just a shadow of our true longing for the concept of beauty itself. God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy is just a bunch of repressed homos trying to rationalize away their debased perversions. What must that be like? From the bottom of my motherf*cking and my fatherf*cking heart, that must be super f*cking hard for them. I can\\'t even imagine. I mean, it makes sense, really. Straight men don\\'t have these problems. They got away with painting softcore for 500 years and never had to think about it. I guess Nietzsche\\'s the exception. He was straight and a philosopher, but he was an Incel, and let\\'s be honest, definitely a (beeping) chaser. The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history is the respectable English gentleman Oscar Wilde. According to Wilde: - [Oscar] \"Those who find ugly meanings \"in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. \"This is a fault. \"Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things \"are the cultivated. \"For these, there is hope. \"They are the elect to whom beautiful things \"mean only beauty.\" - Spoken like a poet. You want to be cultivated, don\\'t you? Don\\'t you think I\\'m beautiful? Look, I\\'ll play it your way. Let\\'s swing back to the other side of the Sarkeesian pendulum here. (metallic clanging) As sentimental as I personally am about art for art\\'s sake and all that, from a strictly sociological perspective, I have to admit taste is pretty intimately related to power. When you go to a museum, you look at various objects on pedestals, under special lighting that makes them appear magical. Now, that\\'s also what you do at Bed Bath & Beyond, but the difference is that at the museum, you can\\'t buy anything, and that turns out to be important for Kantian reasons. In the retail context of commodity fetishism, you correlate your aesthetic taste with material desire. Whereas, in a museum, because you can\\'t buy anything, you feel like your aesthetic pleasure is pure, that you\\'re simply enjoying out-of-context objects. But of course, that\\'s an illusion. The museum is the context, and the context is telling you that the things you\\'re looking at are art. So whoever decides what\\'s in the museum decides what good taste is, what\\'s beautiful, what\\'s valuable. Think about the music video for \"Apesh*t\" by The Carters. Beyonce and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre, conferring upon themselves the status and the cultural grandeur of the art. But it\\'s not just a flex. It means something more than that because of the racial disparity between the performers and the setting. Black people and black art are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre, so seeing Jay and B there looking so regal, with black dancers even overshadowing canonical European art, it\\'s like a full moment. A lot of people have a deep longing for the sense of dignity and grandeur conferred by classical art. That\\'s why trans women love that picture someone photoshopped of the Three Graces, but with d*cks. I\\'ll admit that silly picture actually had an emotional effect on me because here in the West, it\\'s actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful until you\\'ve seen it sculpted in white marble. Oh, speaking of which, white marble is a lie. For most of art history history, scholars have insisted that the iconic ghostly whiteness of classical statues was the distinguishing feature of Western sculpture, proof of the elegant taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans. In reality, of course, it turns out they were painted the colors of something a drag queen might wear to a Quinceanera. Scholars had been noticing paint remnants on these statues for hundreds of years, but were totally in denial about it because the pure whiteness of these figures was like a sacred dogma. Margaret Talbot in The New Yorker attributes the dogma in part to: - [Margaret] \"A tendency to equate whiteness \"with beauty, taste, and classical ideals, \"and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish.\" - [Theryn] Burgeoning! - [Margaret] \"In 2008, Fabio Barry, an art historian \"who is now at Stanford, complained that a boldly-colored \"recreation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus \"at the Vatican Museum looked \"like a crossdresser trying to hail a taxi.\" - Hey, how are you? And you just know that when the news first broke, some horrified WASP classicist turned to a colleague and said, \"Oh, Kingsley, it looks, \"it looks Mexican.\" (laughs) In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues, some art historians have been harassed by the Alt-Right, who don\\'t take kindly to anyone questioning their white supremacist myths about antiquity. There\\'s some pretty insidious, uh, identitarian prejudices here, hiding out under the cloak of taste. Good taste for upper and middle class white people generally includes a reflexive disdain for anything a little bit too colorful. It\\'s these classes that constantly use the words gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky. Jo Weldon, author of \"Fierce: The History of Leopard Print,\" observes that: - [Jo] Tacky, as a concept, refers to the lack of cultivation or the resistance to taste, and more often than not, refers to tastes that are not suitably conservative. Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine, ethnic, queer, deviant, not manly, not practical, not businesslike, not serious. - Aesthetic excess, particularly of colors, patterns, and bling, is especially offensive to conservative WASP taste. - [Jo] Tacky is often where the imagination runs free, where the heart is, where the soul is, and where the fun is. - Well, that\\'s good news, \\'cause people call my aesthetic tacky all the time. I can\\'t imagine why. Let me just get some more jewels on my t*ts. Or camp. People call me camp, and sometimes, I don\\'t know if I\\'m being praised or insulted. I suppose it depends on what camp means. Camp was the theme of this year\\'s Met Gala, and my feed was flooded with Brooklynite intellectuals competing to outwit each other with the most erudite definition of what camp really is. What I gather is there\\'s a couple competing definitions. The first, I\\'ll call coward camp, this bratty hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose. I have no respect for this whatsoever. This is nothing but an anxious and defensive refusal to take a risk. You think you\\'re safe from criticism because your look is bad on purpose. f*ck that! Take a stand, you pussy bitch! I take great offense to this as a person whose look is bad on accident, and Susan Sontag agrees with me. In \"Notes on Camp,\" she distinguishes between: - [Susan] \"Naive and deliberate camp. \"Pure camp is always naive. \"Camp which knows itself to be camp, or camping, \"is usually less satisfying.\" - Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness, a grand artistic vision that gets a little outta control and enters into absurd territory. Hey, how are you? I don\\'t know, my philosophy of style is that people should wear what looks good to them. I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident. I think my aesthetic is good. This is what looks good to me, though I\\'m aware other people might judge it. I like what John Waters said about there being good bad taste and bad bad taste. - [John Waters] \"One must remember, there is such a thing \"as good bad taste and bad bad taste. \"To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.\" - I\\'ve wondered for a long time why I\\'m so attracted to bad taste. Like, I technically have the education to know better. I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace. Why am I so tacky? I think it\\'s because I\\'m a transsexual, which lowers you at least a class. If you were born upper class and you\\'re transsexual, you\\'re middle class now, bitch. If you were born middle class and you\\'re transsexual, you are now lower class. And if you were born lower class and you\\'re transsexual, ooh, sweaty, you\\'d better start a revolution. Uh, Marsha P. Johnson, hey, how are you? Chicks with bricks. (glass shattering) Five, Glamour. Trans women have a special relationship with glamor, at least, those of us who came of age in the 1960s. In the most basic everyday sense, glam is a way of styling yourself. It\\'s luxuriant hair, it\\'s high-drama makeup, it\\'s long nails, it\\'s glitter everywhere, it\\'s posing like a fashion model. But originally, the word glamor comes from the Scottish word gramarye, meaning magic or enchantment. And glamor still involves a kind of illusion, or charm cast on a spectator. The connection between glamor and opulence is explored in the 2004 essay, \"Viva McGlam? \"Is Transgenderism a Critique of or Capitulation to \"Opulence-Driven Glamour Models?\" by transgender writer and underground house music producer Terre Thaemlitz, aka DJ Sprinkles. Sprinkles writes: - [Terre] \"Europe\\'s ruling elite used opulence \"as an ideological weapon to befuddle the lower classes \"with glimpses of heaven on earth, \"a lifestyle so foreign and unattainable \"that it could only be the result of divination. \"It is this spell of opulence \"that led to our current definition of glamor, \"which is more associated with wealth than magic.\" - Sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamor, or gramarye, that was associated with witchcraft, paganism, and sexual deviancy. But in our capitalist society, glamor is a spell of opulence, conjuring up what is often a fantasy of a lavish life. For example, a lot of drag queens practice this sort of illusionism by impersonating celebrities, thereby acquiring the glamor of actresses, pop stars, and models secondhand. Sprinkles is bothered by the way this sort of second-hand glamor acquires its power from unquestioned social hierarchies. - [Terre] \"Glamor is suspect \"as a critical-minded political forum \"because it is about social distance, \"not social integration. \"The promise of the pop-glam diva \"is not the promise of social transformation, \"but individual transformation in which the exploited \"becomes the exploiter. \"It is a promise of an individual\\'s class mobility, \"not social betterment or class critique. \"It is, by and large, the American dream.\" - Now, I have to admit, this is a version of the American dream that hits pretty close to home for me. The overarching plot line of my whole entire YouTube gender journey is that I used to be a tragic mess. And I\\'m still a tragic mess, but when I started this channel, I was a broke, gender dysphoric, alcoholic, crossdressing tragic mess. I\\'d play a clip, but honestly, those videos are still too painful for me to even glance at. And now, I mean, look at me, look how far I\\'ve come. I look like a moderately talented female impersonator, hey, how are you? Those first several months of transition, though, they were rough. I had a lot of trouble in the beginning. I used to get laughed out of restaurants. And I was so proud that I wouldn\\'t let anyone see how much that stuff hurt me. You know, I would say, \"Well, f*ck them. \"I\\'m know I\\'m great.\" And then I\\'d go cry my eyes out alone in my car. And I was a YouTuber that whole time too, which, I mean, the cyberbullying alone, I don\\'t think you can even imagine the extent of it if you haven\\'t been in that situation. You know, hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice, picking apart your face and body, clocking your clothes and makeup, digging up your past, trying to deduce the nature of your sexual pathology from the shape of your skull. (laughs softly) I mean, a lot of it\\'s hilarious to me now, but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain. But that pain spurred me to work on my glow-up like it was the cure for cancer, like my life depended on it, which is basically how it felt. Now, sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as, as one Tweeter put it, \"cripplingly obsessed with passing.\" And passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me, but glam, to me, is not about passing. I think I actually pass better in no makeup than I do in eye shadow out to here. You know, a cis woman can wear eye shadow out to here and people think she\\'s just really into makeup or Instagram or cosplay or something, but when I do it, I think it looks like drag, which serves to call more attention to my situation. But on YouTube, I mean, clearly, I don\\'t try to pass as a normal woman. Everyone here knows I\\'m trans anyway, so what\\'s the point? I would describe this presentation as female impersonator, and that\\'s basically what I am, a female female impersonator. And I present this way because it\\'s fun, I find it artistically fulfilling, and let\\'s be honest, there\\'s part of me that always wanted to be that kind of larger-than-life super-woman. But I\\'m also creating special effects for the camera. As Sprinkles says: - [Terre] \"Glamor offers a strange over-performance \"of gender signifiers, a tenuously woven layer \"of super-femininity, which is so distracting \"that it successfully hides the transgendered body beneath.\" - Now, a lot of leftist trans people have grown disillusioned with the individual class mobility represented by glamor, as well as by transition glow-up narratives. And I think that disillusionment, and a growing revolutionary sentiment, are at the heart of this intense anger and resentment I\\'ve noticed a lot of trans women have for drag queens, for glamorous trans Instagram models, and let\\'s be honest, for me. Here\\'s Sprinkles one more time. - [Terre] \"As long as an MTF\\'s public acceptance \"is gauged by her ability to emulate glamorous body \"and style requirements that elude most, quote, real women, \"then I\\'ll have to ask you to pardon \"this transgendered writer for not feeling represented \"by RuPaul any more than my mother feels represented \"by Marilyn Monroe or Princess Di.\" - A lot of trans women are basically fed up with having to serve the world a fantasy all the time. They want to be seen for who they are without doing any of that sh*t. They\\'re fed up with glamor, they\\'re fed up with realness, they\\'re fed up with RuPaul, and a lot of them are pretty fed up with me. And I oop, and I oop, and I oop. Six, Envy. The Marxist art critic John Berger called glamor the happiness of being envied. - [John Berger] \"Being envied is a solitary form \"of reassurance. \"It depends precisely upon not sharing your experiences \"with those who envy you.\" - But being envied is a form of happiness only in the imagination. The actual experience of being envied sucks. This is the risk of opulence. It invites not just enchanted admiration, but also envy, and where envy goes, the guillotine follows, or at least, vindictive taxation. This is why the experienced rich know to tone down the opulence, build a nice high wall around their properties, and make a lot of high-profile charitable donations. We could call this kind of strategizing the public relations of success. It certainly helps to have a rags-to-riches story, especially if you can make other people feel included in some way in your success. That\\'s part of the appeal of hip hop opulence, is that it seems to elevate not just a single performer, but an entire underclass. Conversely, being perceived as exclusionary, elitist, or snobbish is gonna cost you big in terms of envy management. YouTube music critic ToddInTheShadows did a review of Ariana Grande\\'s song \"7 Rings,\" in which he basically drags Ariana, who apparently is white, for appropriating a bunch of hip hop rags-to-riches signifiers without any of the subtext of starting from the bottom. She\\'s not showcasing a triumph over adversity. She\\'s just a white girl who likes stuff. We started from the bottom, now the whole team\\'s f*cking here. So in Todd\\'s words, the song is a grotesque, bullying, VIP-only privilege flex of a mean girl shoving her wealth in your face. I actually like that song, but I\\'m into that sort of thing. Bully me, Mommy. (groans comically) Fellow students, as a case study in the public relations of success and envy management, let us compare and contrast two successful YouTubers, Jeffree Star and Gigi Gorgeous. There\\'s enough similarities between them for the differences to be interesting. They\\'re both LGB and/or T, they\\'re both white, they\\'re both blonde, sometimes, they\\'re both feminine, they\\'re both rich, and they both flaunt their opulent lifestyles. But nonetheless, people basically seem to like Jeffree Star, whereas Gigi, well, I don\\'t wanna say people don\\'t like her, but they don\\'t relate to her. The best example of this is her 2017 video \"I Wear Walmart for a Week,\" with its gasp-inducing like to dislike ratio. Let\\'s analyze what went wrong here. - So for today\\'s video, I thought we would take it to a place I\\'ve never been, Walmart. - So that\\'s a bad start, gorg. Most Americans have been to Walmart. Never having been marks your upbringing as upper middle class, at least. Treating going to Walmart as some kind of challenge kind of comes across as you and your rich friends being like, \"What if we pretend to be poor for a day?\" - I wonder if we\\'re gonna see any People of Walmart, you know that website? Baby\\'s crying, the trauma. - Gigi, no! You need to turn the shade down, like, 20 notches, gorg. - I keep kicking my shin on this cart. I\\'m literally gonna have bruises. Can someone remake these carts, please? It\\'s dangerous. - They\\'re gonna cut your head off, gorg. - What should we get next? Maybe like a gown for a red carpet? Do they sell gowns here? - This, to me, is peak Gigi, strolling down the aisles of Walmart with a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew that she plucked from the shelves, saying, \"I need something for a red carpet. \"Do they have gowns here?\" This, to me, is an iconic fashion moment. This is naive camp, this is everything. The idea that she has privileges that other people don\\'t has never once crossed her mind, and that is a very special, precious thing that I wanna cherish. Personally, I have no choice but to stan. The YouTube comments section, however, is not as amused as I am, nor as forgiving. This is the second time I\\'ve done a close reading of a Gigi video. It\\'s getting kinda weird. Also, why hasn\\'t she answered my letters? Step on my throat, Mommy. Now, let\\'s look at Jeffree Star. Jeffree does similar kinds of videos to Gigi. He\\'s even done his own video wearing Walmart for a day, which people loved. Now, my first impulse when explaining the differences in public perception is to scream sexism, and there\\'s maybe a little of that going on. I do think a rich woman is more irritating to people than a rich man, but there\\'s clearly more than that going on here. Jeffree\\'s fans are, I assume, mostly women, and not rich women, regular women. The women who work at the dollar store love him. - I\\'m, like, your biggest fan. - Ordinary people actually enjoy watching Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of designer bags and clothes because they either live vicariously through him, or they see him as aspirational. It\\'s the same reason why poor people have always enjoyed watching reality TV shows about the extremely wealthy. The centerpiece of Jeffree Star\\'s brand is that he\\'s self-made. He represents himself as having started from the bottom. You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing, and just generally seems like he hasn\\'t let his wealth go to his head. A good example of this is his Private Jet Burger King Mukbang. Now, at first, you might think that a private jet is not very relatable, but the Burger King aspect brings it back down to Earth. Jeffree seems like he\\'s been to Burger King before. He\\'s able to order fluently. He\\'s even kind of charming to the cashier. He doesn\\'t, like, scoff or pinch his nose at anything. Also, the Gucci barrette. (pops tongue) Whereas Gigi, I mean, don\\'t get me wrong, I do love Gigi, but I don\\'t know if sis would make it out of Burger King alive. You know, she\\'d commit some terrible upper-class solecism, like, I don\\'t know, not understanding the concept of a value meal. I\\'m sure Gigi would make an entertaining video, just not a relatable video. You know, she\\'d somehow contract syphilis from the toilet seat and do a storytime about that. That\\'s really when Gigi\\'s at her best. She kinda comes back down to Earth whenever she\\'s serving Real Transsexual Housewives of Beverly Hills meets David Cronenberg. - So I\\'m like (imitates gagging). I see this white little Chiclet in my hand. I\\'m feeling with my tongue, and I\\'m like, oh, my God! - Economic inequality in this country has always been enabled by the fact that people basically like the rich. Yeah, we judge people who live in McMansions and we get irritated by elitist, out-of-touch behavior, but ultimately, we have no choice but to stan. And the people we stan the hardest are people like Jeffree Star, who, in a way, seems like a poor person who just so happens to be very rich. Now, if inequality increases enough, I suspect the stanning will stop because it\\'s fun to watch Jeffree Star spend $69,000 in one trip to the Louis Vuitton store if what you\\'re doing is fantasizing about what you would buy with that much money. But if you\\'re thinking about how $69,000 could pay off your life-ruining medical debt, or about how you\\'d be able to afford cancer treatments for your dying wife, this kind of thing will start getting under your skin. And eventually, people will start building guillotines again. In fact, the only way I can imagine a revolution happening in this country is if rich people start behaving as badly as possible. - So this isn\\'t your dream job? - No. - And this is free, right? - Oh, whatever you want. - Okay, great. - Seven, Ruin. (somber organ music) Good evening, gorg. Ever notice how most vampires are, like, counts or queens, or at least rich? I guess some are edgy biker teens, but I don\\'t associate with that trash. Gothic horror really got started as a genre with 18th and 19th century novels, which were usually set in an old decaying castle or mansion. By the late 19th century, the aristocracy had lost a lot of its relevance as a class, so aristocrat vampires, like Count Dracula, represented a dying world order, and also, maybe the metaphorical bloodsucking of commoners by the landed gentry. Vampires were also usually seducers, and the aristocrat seducer trope had actually played an important role in turning public opinion against the nobility. So the Gothic aesthetic is an aesthetic of dead and decaying opulence. And that aesthetic has evolved over time, from the ruins of a medieval castle to the iconic haunted house, which, in American horror, is usually a decaying Victorian mansion. It\\'s a trope with an interesting backstory. During the Gilded Age, industrialization produced a new wealthy class of people, who built what were essentially 19th century McMansions. When the Great Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian mansions were abandoned and began to decay, which gave them morbid associations that made them perfect for stories about hauntings and psychos, and weirdos. So ruined opulence becomes Gothic, which kind of makes you think. We live in an age of opulence and inequality, and growing irritation with abusive men in power. The middle class is shrinking, social unrest is on the rise. It seems like a new economic order could be on the horizon. When the opulence of our age decays, will there be a new Gothic aesthetic of ruined shopping malls? Well, there kind of already is. The urban explorer, Dan Bell, is a YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series, in which he explores the ruins of abandoned shopping malls, for example, the now demolished Owings Mills Mall just north of Baltimore. The mall opened in 1986 as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall. - [News Reporter] Champagne, gold dust, and pink feathers heralded in a new era for Owings Mills. Today\\'s opening of the Owings Mills Fashion Mall does not only mean a new high-fashion place to shop, it also means lots of new developments and jobs for Baltimore County. - It had a Macy\\'s, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth Avenue. It was a big high-end mall, but in 1992, a woman who worked as a cleaner at Saks was murdered during an armed robbery on the trail between the mall and the Baltimore Metro Station. After the murder, the mall got a reputation for being unsafe, and slowly, the stores closed down. Dan recorded two videos at Owings Mills in 2015, when only five of the original 155 stores remained. He takes us through the strangely clean and empty halls, the drained fountains, the gutted food court. Watching these videos seems to provoke an emotional response in a lot of people. Some say they feel nostalgic or sad. Some express rage at the waste and futility. Some find it creepy, or even horrifying, and some have a dark sense of humor about the absurdity of it all. One commenter says: - [Female Commenter] \"I think it is still hitting people \"with slow motion shock \"that the 20th century is really over. \"In the \\'80s, this looked like the start of a big new world \"of wealth for everyone. \"In fact, it was the last gasp \"of 20th century general prosperity.\" - I agree with all these comments, and I feel every one of these emotions. I think there is a new aesthetic sensibility emerging here, a Gothic aesthetic for the 21st century, this decaying opulence that is the carcass of 20th century consumerism. Oh, it gives me a chill! My nape hair stands on end and a tingle goes down my spine. (\"Ach wie flüchtig, ach wie nichtig\") The Owings Mills Mall was totally demolished in late 2016. In Dan\\'s final video about it, we see clips from his earlier Owings Mills videos intercut with absolutely post-apocalyptic footage of the half-demolished ruin. It\\'s not like the feeling of exploring a ruined temple or abbey, where you somehow perceive the spiritual significance of the original building. In a dead mall, you do sense the ghosts of the shoppers and the workers, their aspirations and material longings, but what does the crumbling wreckage of a JCPenney really mean? That is a question that will haunt me to the grave. All right, comrades, I\\'ve said my piece. I\\'ll come quietly, there\\'s no reason to tie me down. I mean, unless you\\'re into that, in which case, by all means! No, I won\\'t resist. I accept my fate. (\"Ach wie flüchtig, ach wie nichtig\") f*ck you, Romano. I\\'m glad your father died! (laughing) Just get that out there before I had to say it. And let\\'s be honest, definitely a (beeping) chaser. (laughing) Gosh, I sure do think I\\'m funny. But he was an Incel, and definitely a (beeping) chaser. (laughs) Don\\'t look at me! I\\'m ashamed, I\\'m ashamed of what I\\'ve written. Huh? (mumbling offscreen) Kant, yeah, but I\\'m saying his name wrong \\'cause I\\'m an asshole. (laughs) I hope you\\'re enjoying this, Theryn, watching me rub snot into my hands as I shriek naked in a tub full of jewels. How much leg do we want to get in here? A lot, I assume. Just getting oil all over my fur, great. It\\'s not real fur, whatever. Clarify that for the vegans in my comments section. (scoffs) Moral people. If there\\'s one thing I can\\'t stand, it\\'s people how have some sense of decency. Okay! Is a hair light really a good idea? Why don\\'t we illuminate my frizziness? Who invented that? An asshole. What about a bartender who owns the bar he works in? I guess I\\'ll say she to be feminist. (scoffs) Christ. The demands of these people! These f*cking teeth, man. (laughs) It\\'s like being Tabby. Tabby! Tabby! That is a question that will haunt me to the grave. (laughing) So campy and stupid. Okay.',\n",
       " 6: ' (eerie music) - Hi boys, it\\'s me again, just your average girl. Look I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video, we\\'re able to converse as men. I want you to think back to 2016 which I know in internet years is like halfway between now and the decline of Rome. Do you like history, boys? How did Rome fall again? Was it the gays? Tell me all about it. Back in 2016 the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side and men\\'s rights activists on the other. What ever happened to that? These days it\\'s as dead a meme as I don\\'t know, Harambe. I did want to do the fedora though. Every YouTuber who\\'s ever covered the men\\'s rights movement has done the fedora and I wanted to put my own little twist on it. My wardrobe notes for this video say \"MRA femme fatale\" and \"fedora but make it fashion.\" School shooter realness. I feel like I\\'m also serving a little red-pilled Carmen Sandiego? In this video I wanna ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men? Because, no offense, but, as a group, you guys kind of seem like you\\'re not doing okay. Could a group of people who are purchasing uncucked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting in a state of psychological balance? Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay? I guess yeah, kind of. You don\\'t see a whole lot of psyllium husk in heterosexual medicine cabinets. I\\'m losing my target audience here. Listen my dudes, let\\'s just say I\\'m kinda worried about you guys. And I\\'m not saying I\\'m any better. To be clear, I\\'m not okay either. There\\'s like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now. Yeah, that\\'s right. Women pee too, okay? Get over it. I\\'m so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I for one will not be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit. [dramatic music] You boys, you\\'re very rational, aren\\'t you? (scoffs) I suppose I was too. I admit that these days rationality, it\\'s something I struggle with, both as a biological female and as a Pisces moon. But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men, ContraPoints For Him I started brushing up on my reasoning skills because I wanna be so f*cking rational for you. So to prepare for this video I read Newton\\'s \"Principia Mathematica\", Wittgenstein\\'s \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", and of course the philosophical classic, \"The Rational Male\" by Rollo Caliente. So my mind is well-lubricated and I\\'m ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating intellectual interchange. Look, I wanna play by your rules, okay? So there will be no emotions in this video. I will present my arguments in strict logical form, relying only on facts, reason, evidence, and deductive proof. (Grindr notification) (typing) (Grindr notification) (Grindr notification) (typing) (Grindr notification) Actually, you know what? F*ck that. Let\\'s listen to house music and do sex drugs! (upbeat music) I\\'m pandering to the male gaze! Oh, and the male straights. God I love attention! Hey gorg. Hey gorg. Hey gooooorg. Okay, I\\'m ready. Let\\'s crack open a cold one boys. My hands are too pretty to open the can. I need a man to do it for me. Help. Fuck it. (cork pops) Okay, that\\'s super great. Hey gorg. Hey gorg. If there are any women still watching this video, I\\'m really sorry about all this. Unless you\\'re into that sort of thing, in which case how very dare. I\\'m a good Presbyterian. And by Presbyterian I do mean pansexual heyhowareyou. Look the video\\'s about men so I\\'m trying to be attractive to men. Am I doing this right? Is this what men like? Trap straps! It is a risky look for a girl like me. When you do a lingerie look you know you\\'re gonna wind up somewhere on the Frank-N-Furter/Violet Chachki/Dita von Teese spectrum, oh but you don\\'t know where exactly. And that is a dangerous game ladies. I have to say though I actually am feeling pretty f*cking empowered right, but um that could be because of the drugs. Look, gentlemen, let\\'s be rational. No more fooling around, okay? Part one, oh wait. Rational. Axiom one, America\\'s Next Top Victim I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture. And I\\'m not just talking about campus SJWs with their microaggressions. No bitch, this goes all the way to the top. We have white people whining about reverse racism. We have the literal 1% complaining about \"anti-rich prejudice\" That must be super f*cking hard for you. We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades. You know, flaunting their sexuality in the faces of children who are trying raise a family and protesting in the street like a bunch of (beep). And so of course because there was women\\'s rights there has to be men\\'s rights too. I\\'ve been hearing about men\\'s rights for my whole adult life, and I\\'ve always been very skeptical. Because in my experience, online men\\'s rights activism in practice always looks like this. Women try to do a good thing to solve a real problem and then a man shows up to say, \"Well what about men? \"Men also get harassed. \"Why aren\\'t you talking about men?\" And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men? Of course he\\'s fucking not. He doesn\\'t give a shit. He\\'s a troll. His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with, \"What about men?\" What about them, honey? For this video I decided to actually do some research for once, and the first thing I did was read the foundational text of the modern men\\'s rights movement, which is \"The Myth of Male Power\" by Warren Farrell. Actually I listened to the audiobook \\'cause let\\'s be honest, reading is hard. But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it to. Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender role that confined women to domestic servitude. But, he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society is actually an illusion, because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive. He introduces the idea of male disposability, basically the idea that society values female lives more than male lives, which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting and providing for women and children. And he points to statistics showing that men make up the majority of military casualties, workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on. So we\\'re supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power than women, in fact the queens have a certain kind of privilege in being protected and provided for by the expendable male worker bees. And I guess that kinda makes sense. I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view. What I\\'m saying is, I took the red pill. And I rubbed it on my cliiiiiiit. But some initial objections come to mind. Like, haven\\'t men been almost all of the kings, presidents, and CEOs for millennia? Didn\\'t men make up all these rules in the first place? I don\\'t know, boys. Still seems kinda patriarchal to me. But maybe you\\'ll say that it\\'s only at the top of society that men have more power than women. Maybe the average man is also oppressed by this system that feminists call patriarchy. If that\\'s what you\\'re saying I think I basically agree with that. See, what you have to understand about me is I am such a f*cking Libra. Whenever there\\'s a conflict my gut reaction is to be like, well, maybe everybody\\'s right. And maybe there\\'s good points on both sides and we should all just listen to each other and rub each others cliiiiiiits. But no, my Scorpio-rising persona will not allow that. Oh, there will be a champion, there will be blood. So, judges, how do we decide which gender is America\\'s next top victim? I mean it\\'s not like you can just change genders and see how the other half lives. Or can you? (dramatic music) Proposition two, Diary of an Ex-Man. - (V.O.) Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal that on the inside I\\'m drowning in darkness! - Mom! Get out of my room. Ugh, You\\'re ruining my life! Look. I\\'ve never, ever talked about this on my channel before so this is like a super f*cking vulnerable moment for me, but I was born a boy. Well, was I ever really a boy? It\\'s hard to say. - (V.O.) Dear diary, growing up I always knew that I was different from other kids, especially other boys. And it took me so long to pinpoint what it was, but there was this moment. I must have been what, seven, eight years old? And I was playing in my parents\\' room all by myself, and I saw this pair of my mom\\'s shoes lying on the floor and I don\\'t know what it was. It was like this magnetism that drew me to them, and I put my little feet in them and walked in front of the mirror and I didn\\'t really have the words yet to describe how I felt, but basically in that moment I sensed that God had made a mistake and I was destined to be, to be a crossdresser. - That is super f*cking coconuts. Anyway then in my 20s my life completely fell apart and I became a woman. Hey, how are you? I became one of... (chimes) the dolls. My plastic surgeon is an artist. Look, boys, the point I\\'m trying to make here is I used to live your lifestyle. I know what people like you get up to and I think it\\'s disgusting. I gotta say though, since I transitioned, my life has been super f*cking great. Like, way better. Now of course a lot of that is not because women have it better than men, but because, hey gorg, I am literally transgendered! So before I transitioned I was dying inside. You know, I was in the wrong body. And now (sighs) it\\'s like I finally have the body I was meant to die inside of! But it\\'s not just that. I do think that, in some ways, since I started presenting as a woman, people actually do treat me better. I mean, they take my opinions less seriously sure, but that\\'s probably for the best. Now before using my personal experience as any kind of evidence, I guess I should say a couple caveats. Caveat one is that most pre-transition trans women are not like other boys and most of us were not living the business-class male experience by any means. You know, it\\'s a lot of drunk melancholics, tormented sissies, secretive transvestites, poets, you know, that sort of thing. Caveat two is that MY trans experience is not THE trans experience, and I do have a lot of other privileges that made things go super f*cking well for me heyhowreyou. Don\\'t you just love it when someone checks their privilege in a way that\\'s actually just bragging? You know it\\'s super important for me to acknowledge that I\\'ve been so successful and I\\'ve come so far in part because I\\'m white and I\\'m skinny and I\\'m young and I\\'m blonde and I\\'m rich and I pass and I\\'m educated and I\\'m popular and my plastic surgeon is an artist and my boyfriend is really rich and hot and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline. And part of what makes me so enlightened and so compassionate is that I\\'m able to recognize these privileges that I have that just might not be available to people who are less fortunate. From the bottom of my motherf*cking and my fatherf*cking heart that must be super f*cking hard for you. I can\\'t even imagine. What I was saying is there are ways that people treat me better now that I\\'m presenting as a woman. You know, people smile at me more. I feel more taken care of. Men do things for me! Now a lot of women don\\'t like men doing things for them. You know, holding doors, helping with luggage because they feel that it\\'s infantalizing or condescending. But not me. I love it, both because I love attention and because I am a recumbent queen who\\'s too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger. I do this thing on airplanes where when it\\'s time for me to put my carry-on luggage in the overhead bin, I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift, and then some man will usually get up and do it for me, even though I\\'m taller than most men. It makes me happy! Another good thing about becoming a woman is I integrated more into female social groups, and I found that they provide a kind of communal support and overt affection that male social groups generally just don\\'t. I find the female social style suits me better than the male one, which tends to be more atomized, more individualist, where affection is always concealed behind this semi-jokey front of competition. Like think about the way boys talk to each other when they\\'re playing video games. A third improvement for me has to do with the way men and women are treated differently in public space. When you present female in public you\\'re more likely to be treated as a spectacle to be commented upon. People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions about you, sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting, sometimes just f*cking weird. Whereas when you present male in public you\\'re more likely to be treated either as invisible or as dangerous. Now feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences as men asserting dominance over women in public space, and they\\'ve criticized catcalling as being objectifying, degrading, and misogynistic. And it certainly can be all of those things. But there\\'s different kinds of catcalling, and I have different feelings about them. If I\\'m walking with another woman and a man says, \"Ladies, you look beautiful tonight,\" I don\\'t know, I like that. I think that\\'s nice. It makes me feel seen. It makes me feel admired. It boosts my confidence. Whereas, if I\\'m walking alone and a drunk starts following me down the street singing, \"Have you seen Polythene Pam? \"She\\'s so good looking, but she looks like a man!\" That I am less enthusiastic about. I mean not that that\\'s ever happened. I\\'m completely f*cking unclockable heyhowreyou... ♪ No one knows what it\\'s like ♪ ♪ To be a sad tran ♪ I definitely get where feminists are coming from because street harassment sucks. I\\'m a lot more afraid walking alone at night than I used to be, and there\\'s a lot more places I just won\\'t go by myself. But on the other hand, I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night without other people acting afraid of me. I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine the ways that being treated as invisible or dangerous can also kind of suck. In my video on incels I talked about male invisibility on dating apps and how getting no attention at all can actually be emotionally worse than getting a lot of sh*tty attention. And when it comes to being treated as dangerous, when I was living as a man sometimes if I was walking at night, a woman on the same block as me would change sides of the street. And I totally get why. Men do scary shit sometimes, and it\\'s better to be safe. But it still stung a little bit to be treated as dangerous by default. I think it can actually be harmful, which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation. There\\'s ways that white women\\'s fear can actually be dangerous in particular to black men. I had an experience with this recently when I was filming my video \"The Apocalypse\" and I\\'d rented a room in a hotel casino. Around midnight I was carrying some camera equipment up to my room, and I got into the elevator with a group of people from the casino floor. A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator except for me and a single black man. Well, I mean he was alone, but I don\\'t know if he was single. That\\'s not part of the story. And as soon as the door closed he started literally whistling Row, Row, Row Your Boat, the official melody of performative innocence. And I realized oh sh*t, he\\'s afraid that I\\'m afraid. And I found that just excruciating. I was like oh God. How do other white women behave in elevators? Do they like, clutch their purses? (groans) That\\'s so f*cking embarrassing. Nothing like that had ever happened to me when I was living as a man. It\\'s not a thing between black men and white men. It\\'s a thing between black men and white women. And so that dynamic was there not just because I\\'m white and he\\'s black, but because I\\'m a woman and he\\'s a man. And I thought of that incident again when I was listening to \"The Myth of Male Power\" and Farrell says, \"Men\\'s greatest weakness \"is their facade of strength, \"and women\\'s greatest strength \"is their facade of weakness.\" I think there is some truth to the idea that women\\'s perceived vulnerability can make them powerful, and men\\'s perceived power can make them vulnerable. Now I hope you\\'re taking all of this with a grain of salt because these are just some little observations I\\'ve made based on a handful of anecdotes. And as rational males it\\'s important that we consider the facts, the stats, and the figures. Did you know that 46% of men are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women? Look it up. I haven\\'t. I guess my super f*cking Libra opinion is that there\\'s upsides and downsides to male and female experience. I don\\'t actually think there\\'s a single definite answer to the vague and useless question, \"Which gender has it worse?\" I consider myself a feminist because I support reproductive rights and I oppose workplace misogyny and I generally agree with a lot of the activism that happens under the heading of feminism. But I also think a lot of men are just having a super f*cking difficult time right now and that must be super f*cking hard for them heyhowreyou. And I don\\'t think feminists have an obligation to care about male angst, but I care about you boys. God, I\\'m such a cool girl, ️ I think the entire mid-Atlantic region is about to freeze over. No, I\\'m just a super f*cking empathetic Pisces moon, and I really try to understand other people\\'s pain because I just find it really, really funny. I\\'m also really, really sobering up here. The drugs have worn off, and I am suddenly feeling very naked. Like it\\'s just now occurring to me that this is a highly inappropriate outfit for this occasion. So, I\\'m gonna go put on a robe, and I\\'ll meet you back for the next section. Postulate three, The Man Question. (upbeat music) Hi boys, et cetera, et cetera. Heyhowareyou? For the last three years on this channel I have been your Virgil, leading you through gender hell. Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels, radical feminists, non-binary genders, men\\'s rights activists. It seems like everybody\\'s having gender trouble. So what do we make of that? Well gorg, a very, very rational male philosopher named Hegel once said that the unfolding of history is a basically rational process, gorg. That means that at any time in history, society is based on certain principles, like all men are created equal as long as they\\'re super f*cking white and rich. And there\\'s always contradictions within those principles, which creates tension and eventually leads to a rupture, like a revolution, where society has to be reorganized according to new principles. At least, I think he was saying something like that. It\\'s pretty hard to make anything out through the fog of his unreadable, hyper-abstract man-jabbering. God, I can\\'t stand that shit or any of the other music-hating volcels of the male philosophical tradition. My point is I think our society has reached a place where gender as we know it just isn\\'t working anymore. Now no one seems to agree why it isn\\'t working or how to fix it, but we do all agree that it\\'s broken. We have mainstream feminists saying we need to continue advancing the rights of women. We have conservatives saying we need restore the gender roles of the 1950s. We have an increasing number of people not identifying as men or women. We have TERFs who think that the transgenders are the single greatest threat to civilization, heyhowareyou? And we have men\\'s rights activists saying we need a male equivalent to feminism to liberate men from their oppressive gender role. Now I wanna focus on that last one because in principle I agree. I\\'ve spent a lot of the last three years covering the manosphere. I know, such a feminine topic. Love that for me. And from all the time I\\'ve tortured myself wading through these communities of incels, pick-up artists, men\\'s rights slacktivists, intellectual dark web fanboys, and alt-right racists, I\\'ve noticed that they all have one thing in common, which is that they all recruit from the same massive pool of sad young men. We all know the archetype. He has trouble relating to women. He has no strong friendship group. He\\'s not excited about any long-term goals, and he fills the void with video games and porn. And just to clarify, I\\'m not trying to take away your video games and porn. I\\'m not telling what to do with your penis. You can rub one out to this video for all I care. Just don\\'t pull a Gamergate on me, okay? (sighs) I live in fear. Look, I like to believe that until the red-pillers inject their poison, most of these boys are not bad people. I think this all originates in a genuine crisis of male identity. And I think it\\'s happened in something like the way men\\'s rights activists describe. The sacrificial role of men as warriors is no longer widely glorified or necessary. The traditional protector/provider role of men is being replaced by a more equal and undefined gender dynamic. And college professors and activists are telling men that most of our culture\\'s aspirational representations of manhood are toxic and bad. But without an attractive replacement vision of aspirational manhood, average young men can only imagine their future as... what? The beta. The cuck. The nu male. And in a post-LeftTube internet, we\\'re so used to laughing at this vocabulary, and to be fair it is very funny, but we forget, especially us grills, that for a lot of men these words actually do tap into a deep, existential angst. And a lot of leftists go, \"Well how can men be so angsty, especially white men? \"They\\'re so privileged.\" But existential angst is often a disease of privilege. If you\\'re actually being oppressed you have a struggle. You have something to fight for, and therefore a purpose. But for a lot men their lack of purpose puts them in search of a struggle. And that, along with the loneliness and the lack of a positive identity is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment by the manosphere groups and by the alt-right. And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor for the small but growing number of young men who decide to pick up a gun and open fire in a shopping center. There were two mass shootings during the weekend I was writing this video, resulting in 31 deaths. Both shooters were young white men, and one of them posted about the shooting on an alt-right image board. Now I don\\'t pretend to fully understand the motives of mass shooters, but I don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence that basically all of them are men. One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic is that these killers are trying to resurrect some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory and therefore to be seen and recognized as men by unleashing Homeric violence in a f*cking Walmart. And of course there\\'s also the racism of the alt-right killers and the wounded sexual entitlement of the incel killers. But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned, and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis are much more receptive to learning it. So you can try to take down their forums and ban their accounts and deplatform their events, but as long as this male identity crisis goes on, I don\\'t see any end to these problems. Theorem four, What Do? There\\'s this media narrative that has emerged around me and around this channel. And by the way, the fact that there\\'s any kind media narrative about this channel is super f*cking coconuts. Because let\\'s be real gorg, I just wanted to pour milk on my face and talk about the mouthfeel. But there\\'s this media narrative that my role in the discourse is \"de-radicalizing \"young \"alt-right men.\" And it\\'s true that if you read the leftist YouTube fan subreddits, I used to be alt-right posts are so common they\\'re considered cliché. And some of them cite me as an influence in changing their politics, which I love for them and I\\'m super f*cking happy about it, but it\\'s also a lot of responsibility. They\\'re (Grindr notification) my boys. And I worry about (Grindr notification) my boys. Because in reality it\\'s not like they go from far-right extremists to complacent centrists. No. Most of them go far left. A lot of times they become communists or anarchists. So I watch them go from far to my right to significantly to my left. It\\'s not really de-radicalizing so much as re-radicalizing. And I think it\\'s definitely an improvement, but I still worry it\\'s not gonna be good enough. I worry about (Grindr notification) my boys. Because I don\\'t think that the left yet has a final solution to the man question. Oh no. That was worded poorly. You know, there\\'s kind of two options the left has for disillusioned men. The first is the Marxist promise of economic revolution. We say, \"Well, actually yes, you are oppressed. \"But you\\'re oppressed because of your class, not your gender. \"So just join the revolution. \"It\\'s gonna be super f*cking crazy. \"We\\'re gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie, \"meow meow, \"smash no voting, and then things will be better for you.\" Now, I think that has a couple limitations. One is that I look at the far left and I see a bunch of people who spend all their time accusing each other of abusing moderator privileges in closed Facebook groups. And I\\'m concerned that might not succeed at ending capitalism. Meow meow Like, definitely vote for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or whoever, but if you\\'re investing all of your hopes in a capital R Revolution, I worry that can become like waiting for Godot or waiting for the rapture. So we do need political change, but I feel like I\\'m failing (Grindr notification) my boys if I\\'m somehow giving them the idea that revolution is their only hope. Cause here\\'s the other thing. Even if we did succeed at ending capitalism, there would still be gender, and (Grindr notification) my boys would still need some model of what it is to lead a good life as a man. Now the other option the left has for disillusioned men is the feminist tranquilizer. We say, \"Look, toxic masculinity is the reason \"you don\\'t have room to express your feelings, \"and it\\'s the reason you feel lonely and inadequate.\" So, while feminism tells women, \"You hate your body \"and you\\'re constantly doubting yourself \"because society did this to you and needs to change,\" we kinda just tell men, \"You\\'re lonely and suicidal \"because you\\'re toxic. \"Stop it.\" We tell them that they\\'re broken without really telling them how to fix themselves. I think what men need is a new, positive ideal of manhood, which I don\\'t think is something that women cannot create for men, even if they wanted to. And honestly the best way for that to happen may actually be some kind of men\\'s movement. But on the left the whole idea of a men\\'s movement is basically taboo because the men\\'s movement we all know is basically just a backlash to feminism, and at worst, it\\'s just straight-up misogyny. And look boys, I understand that being lectured about manspreading for most of 2015 was super fucking hard for you and you\\'re still mad about it, but posting endless outrage p*rn about false r*pe accusations and paternity fraud isn\\'t actually gonna make life any better for you. Because yes, those things are horrible when they happen, but they\\'re not systemic issues that affect most men. I think what would actually improve life for most men is a positive ideal of 21st century manhood, but that\\'s not something I can give to you because in case you hadn\\'t noticed I\\'m literally a fu*cking woman. I can\\'t mom you through this one boys. You\\'re on your own. You have to help each other. So find each other in the comments section. Meet up on Reddit. Make friends. Clean your room. Leave the house. F*ck each other. (Grindr notification) I don\\'t know. It\\'s worth a try. And failing that, you could always throw in the towel and become a woman. Worked for me! (upbeat music) - I\\'m just trying to give like m\\'lady energy. - Yeah, it is. It is English. It\\'s very John Maclean. Very Quentin Crisp, very aristocrat. I\\'m super f*cking naked right now. That\\'s crazy. That\\'s super f*cking crazy. According to traditional gender roles, men are useful for their labor and women are useful for their wombs. Well, I\\'m a woman without a womb so I guess I\\'m useless. But I\\'m beautifully useless. Agh! I\\'m a work of art! The problem with our society is we\\'ve turned men into women. It\\'s disgusting. As an ally to men, it\\'s not my place to speak for them or speak over them, but I just want to use my platform to uplift some male voices who might not have as many subscribers as me. I\\'m not hypergamous. I don\\'t need a rich husband. If I may quote Cher, \"I don\\'t need a rich man. \"I am a rich man.\" It\\'s not even much of an insult being called a delusional man. Many great books have been written by delusional men. So bad. I\\'m bad. I\\'m really bad. Okay.',\n",
       " 7: ' (intense music) - Comfort ye, comfort ye my subscribers, so saith your Goddess. For it is I, the digital messiah, the online oracle, the social media savior, yea! Verily I say unto you, there were influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night. And lo, I came upon them, and the glory of my posts shone about me, and I delivered unto them a vision! (soft music) - Freedom, freedom, f*cking freedom. Which matters more, the freedom to live an authentic life, or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel of a jackboot? As a centrist I am undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it. Hi, I\\'m Jackie Jackson, welcome to the Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss important issues, like Mexicans, how dangerous are they? Muslims, can we stop them? Tonight, we return once again to the dangerous transgender trend that is turning your children into all manner of half-and-halfs and in-betweens. I mean look at this, they\\'re transing 13-year-olds now. What\\'s next? Babies with breast implants? It makes me wanna throw up. I live in constant fear. And fear is what freedom is all about. Cut the music! Tonight my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and conservative opinion-haver. And my second guest, well what the hell are you? You\\'re transgender, you\\'re a man, you\\'re a woman, you\\'re an attack helicopter, what\\'s your deal? - Well Jackie Jackson, my, as you say, deal is I don\\'t like society forcing me into tiny little boxes. - Okay but are you a man or a woman, just tell me. - Well why does it matter? Why do you have to know? Maybe you should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these little categories, Jackie Jackson. - Well can I at least ask your name or is that now considered cisgender imperialism? - My name is Baltimore. - Baltimore what? - Baltimore Maryland. - I\\'m sorry, your name is Baltimore Maryland? - It is among my names. - Tiffany what do you make of this? - Look Jackie, I\\'m gonna be completely real with you. I am a transsexual. That means I have a very specific mental disorder called gender dysphoria. I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance in the womb. This is a real psychiatric disorder, that is verified by science, and requires hormones and surgery for treatment, or else I literally cannot function. It is not a fashion statement, it is not a trend, it is not an easy way to feel special and oppressed; it\\'s a very difficult condition to live with. (intense music) I\\'m dying inside. - Okay so you\\'re both transsexuals then. - No. I am a transsexual. That is not a transsexual. That is a transtrender. - Transtrender? What is that, is that a gender? - No it\\'s not a gender. A transtrender is a person, like Baltimore over here, who puts on a dress and puts glitter in his beard and goes around telling people he\\'s transgender and complaining about \"misgendering\" for oppression points. - Actually, it\\'s they. - What? - I use they/them pronouns. - \"They\" go around collecting oppression points, as you can see. - Why do you say that, Tiffany Tumbles? Have I complained about oppression so far? It seems to me that it\\'s you who have been complaining about your dysphoria. Isn\\'t it you who\\'s collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles? - No I\\'m not, I\\'m not saying I\\'m oppressed. I\\'m saying I have dysphoria, which is not society\\'s fault, it\\'s in my brain, I was diagnosed, it\\'s a fact, it\\'s real, my pain is real. - And my pain isn\\'t real? It\\'s interesting that you think that. - Well what pain are you talking about, people making fun of you because you dress like a circus act? - Interesting that you mention the circus, Tiffany Tumbles. Don\\'t you think we should examine why society confines gender variant people to the circus? - You\\'re not confined anywhere, you choose to dress like that. - And why do you choose to dress the way you dress? - Because I\\'m a woman, so I\\'m dressed like a woman. Hello. - And I\\'m non-binary, so I dress non-conforming. Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people? - Well it\\'s a free country, if you wanna be a glitterbeard genderf*ck then go ahead. But don\\'t go around telling people that you\\'re transgender, because it makes us look like a bunch of trendy freaks. - But aren\\'t we all freaks in the eyes of society? Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity? Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles. That is simply adding another cell to the prison. - It\\'s not about conforming. It\\'s about me having an actual medical condition. You do not have a female brain, you have a fashion disaster. - Oh do they? Well tell me, Tiffany Tumbles, when the doctor prescribed your hormones, did he take a look at your brain then? - What? Of course not. - But you have seen a scan of your brain yes? - Well no. Where are you going with this? - I mean, if you\\'ve never seen your brain, and the doctor who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn\\'t look at it, then, tell me Tiffany Tumbles, how do you know that you have a female brain? (slurps) - Well shit. That\\'s a good point. - No it isn\\'t! Look, there\\'s scientific studies. - Can you explain to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain? Are they different colors? - I\\'m not an expert. But there\\'s science showing that men and women have brain differences. - I see. But your doctor never looked at your brain. So how did he know you have gender dysphoria? - Well he asked me questions and I told him about it. - And you told him what exactly? - That I experience gender dysphoria. - So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria and therefore your identity is valid not because of any observed facts about your brain, but because of your fffffeelings? - Well congratulations Attorney Frank-N-Furter, you backed me into a corner. Sure, it\\'s because of my feelings. My feelings of gender dysphoria. - So tell me, Tiffany Tumbles, why is it that your feelings about your are gender valid, but mine, according to you, are not? - [Tiffany V.O.] This burgeoning brick. - You guys, let\\'s think about this. If I\\'ve never seen my brain, then how do I know I even have a brain? - Well you probably don\\'t girl. Look, Baltimore, I\\'m sure you have lots of feelings about your gender, and if you feel cloudgender or demi-nebula or astroglide, or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind, then you do you girl... or not girl, whatever the f*ck you are. But I want to make one thing very clear. I am nothing like you. Okay? My gender is not unicorns and glitter, my gender it is a serious psychiatric diagnosis that I wouldn\\'t wish on my worst enemy. No, not even you. - My, I\\'m really getting under your skin, aren\\'t I? - No, well actually, yes, to be honest, you are. You\\'re getting under my skin because it really rattles my dysphoria that you\\'re sitting here claiming to represent the transgender community, when in fact you\\'re just making a mockery of my pain. - Your pain, you\\'re in a lot of pain, aren\\'t you, Tiffany Tumbles? - Well... - I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room. And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles. I pity you because you don\\'t think that you\\'re real until a man in a lab-coat signs a prescription pad. And I can\\'t imagine what it must be like to have so little confidence in your own reality. - Okay, well don\\'t patronize me. - I\\'m just trying to understand, Tiffany Tumbles, why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself and hating your body. Why can\\'t trans identity be joyful and celebratory? - No, you don\\'t have to hate yourself or hate your body. But you do have to have dysphoria. And if you tell people otherwise you\\'re just misleading them. - I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles. Would you please join me in saying a prayer for your wellness? - Actually, I would strongly prefer that you stay away from any of my rifts. - O Goddess of Light, please shield and protect Tiffany against the ravages of inner strife. - Oh Jesus. - [Baltimore] Enclose her in your loving arms, and cleanse her of all of condemnation. - What the f*ck? - And internalized transphobia. I entreat you, O Great Mother, bathe Tiffany in inner peace, acceptance, and self-care, and rid her of her toxic cisnormative truscum ways. Amen. - Are we done here? I don\\'t think I can make it through any more readings from the SJW prayerbook. - Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love I am trying to deliver unto you? - Because I\\'m grossed out by you that\\'s why. - Okay then. Well namaste bitch! - Look, why don\\'t we all take a step back and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform and let them know how much we appreciate their service. God, I love the troops! Thinking about the troops makes me wet, it makes me come. Semper fi boys! - What? - I think I\\'m starting to wrap my head around this. Tiffany, your transsexualism, I have to say I don\\'t love it, but you do seem to at least be aware that you have some kind of mental disorder, so I\\'ll give you that. Whereas Baltimore, you\\'re what, making some kind of statement? - If my existence is a statement, I think that says more about society than it says about me. - Jackie what you have to understand is there have been transsexuals around for a long time, I\\'ve talked to 80-year-old transsexuals and they agree with me, that all this genderqueer bullshit is just a trend. It\\'s a fad. - But is it? For thousands of years there have been third-gender groups across human cultures. There\\'s the Hijra of India, the two-spirit people among native Americans. Whereas, binary transsexualism is a medical construct of the 20th century. Gender dysphoria wasn\\'t even a recognized mental condition until 2013, meaning that Tumblr is twice as old as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis. So perhaps it is you, Tiffany Tumbles, and not I who is following a trend. (slurps) - Woah. That just blew my mind. The tables are turned bitch! Tiffany could you explain to me why you decided to become a transtrender? (intense music) - He\\'s not Native American though! - They. - They! You know it\\'s kind of hard not to call you \"he\" when you have a f*cking beard. If you were actually trans, and you actually had dysphoria, then you wouldn\\'t be comfortable with that. - Your honor, in my defense it is a glitter beard. - Okay well that\\'s very 2019, very gender, very they. But what it isn\\'t is two spirit. Look the SJWs don\\'t even agree with this, they think it\\'s racist. White people have two genders. Pick one and sit down, dude. - Yeah that\\'s a good point. Two genders, two genders. Attack helicopter. It\\'s ma\\'am. - Okay, well now you\\'re just berating me. - My name is Baltimore, I think there\\'s 76 genders because I don\\'t think you need dysphoria to be trans. - Two genders. - Okay you\\'re just saying that you\\'re me and talking in a whiny voice. That is not an argument. - Waaahh, the toxic truescum bullies are gate keeping my gender, I don\\'t have dysphoria. - You know kids, the one thing you\\'ll always have to deal with in life is assholes. It\\'s hard to be yourself. But it\\'s worth it. Let\\'s be ourselves. Let\\'s totally be ourselves. - Alright, that\\'s enough of this. You know, as a biological female I honestly don\\'t understand any of this tr(beep)ny shit. - Okay, that was a hard T. - Now does my husband sometimes wear panties around the house and ask me to call him mommy\\'s little slut? Well sure, but that is a matter between her and the Lord. It\\'s best not to think about it too much. Anyway, uh, Tiffany my brain has an easier time processing you than whatever\\'s going over here, so, congratulations you\\'re the winner. That was some excellent free speech. - Okay. Great. - So in conclusion, transtrenders are real and probably dangerous. Make sure to protect your children. As for how many genders there are, you know, what I\\'m gonna take the centrist route and say, two and a half. Alright that\\'s our show, this has been the Freedom Report, where the debate never stops. Except when the show\\'s over. Get out. - The girl can\\'t help it, she\\'s a Libra. (soft music) - Behold, the non-binary lamb, who was despised and rejected. They gave their cheek to them that mocked their beard, and hid not their face from shame. But lo, Tiffany, the persecutrix, trannier than thou, a shady queen, came next upon her friend Justine, and sought her counsel thus. (soft music) - Goddamn it Justine, I just can\\'t with these trenders anymore, I simply cannot. - You know you can just text me \"here\" and I\\'ll come open the door. - Okay. Seems a little formal. (scoffs) You look great, hon. - Cute. - Justine you look like absolute shit. What happened? Did the catgirl finally beat you up? - No I just, look I slept in my makeup okay. Leave me alone, I\\'ve been having a difficult time. - Oh are we serving a little depression moment? Jesus, well don\\'t leave me out. - I saw you on the Freedom Report today. - Okay girl can we talk about ladybeard Baltimore Maryland? Add that one to the crazy tr(beep)ny hall of fame. - Really? You\\'re happy with the way that went? You feel good about that? You feel good about yourself right now? - Well why wouldn\\'t I? - Tiffany there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world than a tran who thinks she\\'s better than other trans. It\\'s like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie. You seem to think that you\\'re queen of the world because you\\'re hanging onto societal acceptance by two fingers instead of one. Well you\\'re not bitch. You\\'re just an insecure, frightened little queer who\\'s determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread other people down. And if I\\'m being honest, I don\\'t find that very admirable. - Your eyelash is coming unglued. - My life is coming unglued. - Look it\\'s not like I\\'m coming after tr*nnies who just can\\'t afford to transition or don\\'t have the social support. It\\'s not like Baltimore is doing everything he can to pass and people just treat him like a freak for no reason. - They. It\\'s they. - Are we really saying they now, in private? - Yes, we are. So get used to it. - My name is Justine, I think misgendering is toxic because I care about people\\'s feelings. I always forget that you\\'re like, actually an SJW. - I always forget that you\\'re actually an asshole. Why do I even hang out with you? - Oh because you hate yourself? And you have to believe there\\'s hope for me because if there\\'s hope for me there might be hope for you? - Wow you\\'re developing self-consciousness, where\\'d you learn that trick? - Gigi? - Tiffany have you ever been bullied? - Oh let\\'s see let me think. Only K through 12, nine hours a day. But you don\\'t see me going on talk shows to play the victim. - No I see you going on talk shows to play the bully. I think you grew up getting bullied for being a sissy till you started passing as a woman, and then you got a little taste of normal, and now you wanna be the one who bashes the queers. - Bash them? If anything I\\'m the one defending trans people from appropriation and misrepresentation by these trenders. - You said on air that Baltimore grosses you out. Do you really expect me to believe that your motivations here have nothing to do with your own self-loathing? - How could it be self-loathing when Baltimore is nothing like me. - Okay then it\\'s just bigotry, that\\'s even worse. - Oh it\\'s not bigotry. Look I shouldn\\'t have said grossed out, I\\'ll give you that. But he does...(scoffs) they do make uncomfortable. - And why do you think that is? - I get second-hand dysphoria looking at someone so... burgeoning. Yeugh. Makes me wanna down a bottle of hormones, make sure I never look like that. - Bitch second-hand dysphoria, what is that? - You know when you look at a (beep) and you just clock everything and you feel like, sympathetic vibrations of dysphoria? - Yeah I do know what you\\'re talking about, and I\\'ll tell you why it happens. When you\\'re early in your transition, and you\\'re doing everything you can to pass, you develop a really sophisticated eye for every little thing that makes you clockable. Then, you turn that sophisticated eye onto other trans people, and you project your dysphoria onto them. - I buy that. - Yeah, well that is absolutely not a valid reason to police other trans people\\'s presentation. Second-hand dysphoria is not valid. The fact that you project your dysphoria onto other people is your problem and your problem alone. And you need to deal with that issue in private girl, not on a f*cking talk show. - Yeah you\\'re probably right about that. But it still doesn\\'t make Baltimore Maryland any more valid. - Tiffany, let\\'s be pragmatic about this. Suppose everything you\\'re saying is true. Suppose the only real trans people are dysphoric binary transgender people. - Transsexuals. - Every time you say the word transsexual I feel like it\\'s 1978. Are you 80 years old? - I guess you could say I\\'m not the trendiest person. - Ha ha, Look suppose you\\'re right, and everyone who doesn\\'t meet your definition of a transsexual is some kind of confused trend-follower. Even if that were true, and to be clear, it isn\\'t, what you\\'re doing harms even the trans people you think are valid, because virtually every trans person goes through a period of being confused about their gender, and of having non-conforming expression, and you\\'re going around enforcing a stigma against that. Didn\\'t you ever have doubts about your gender? Weren\\'t you ever androgynous? - Oh yeah I mean I was never that burgeoning but I had my little cringe year of being a non-binary SJW. - Uh-huh. And one of the great things about non-binary identities is they give trans people the conceptual space to exist even when neither gender really fits them, whether that\\'s for their entire life or just for a couple months. Hasn\\'t it occurred to you that being shamed and berated for being a trender during your exploration year might not have been the most helpful thing? - Not really. I have dysphoria so if anyone called me a trender, I\\'d eventually prove them wrong. That\\'s all I\\'m saying. If you\\'re not a trender, then transition, prove me wrong. - But stigma you perpetuate against gender confusion and experimentation keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition, it alienates baby trans from the community that should be welcoming them instead of publicly humiliating them. And when you appoint yourself the public decider of whomst is really trans, the Torquemada of the trender inquisition, you\\'re terrorizing a lot of people who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out. - Okay but then how do we decide which (beep) are valid? - We don\\'t. - Then this is where I\\'m losing you. Because transtrenders are absolutely a thing, like undeniably. I\\'ve talked to people who\\'ve literally told me they used to be transtrenders. - So some people question their gender but end up deciding they\\'re not really trans. There\\'s nothing wrong with that, and those people still aren\\'t being helped by public shaming. - Well maybe they wouldn\\'t be confused in the first place if SJWs weren\\'t going around telling people they don\\'t need dysphoria to be trans. You know it\\'s one thing if teenage girls want to dye their hair pink and call themselves demi-boys for most of sophomore year. But some of these kids are actually going to medically transition, and soon we\\'re gonna have an epidemic of detransitioners on our hands, and there\\'s gonna be TERFs publishing \"I told you so\" op-eds in every major newspaper. Now maybe you think that\\'s all worth it just to make sure no one ever feels invalidated for any reason, but I think that\\'s highly irresponsible. - Look if you\\'re so worried about people feeling pressured to medically transition, then what you should be doing is working to make the trans community as inclusive and welcoming as possible to gender non-conforming people, and non-binary people, and people who are questioning, and trans people who don\\'t medically transition. But instead you\\'re doing the exact opposite. You\\'re telling everyone that medical transition is the only way to be valid. And if anything is pressuring people to medically transition, it\\'s that. - Justine I think you\\'re a good person, maybe too good, and that\\'s why you\\'re trying to have compassion for everyone. But at some point you have to protect yourself. We live in a world of Jackie Jacksons who don\\'t understand trans people and don\\'t think we\\'re real. So we need to have an explanation of what it is to be trans that is based on facts and not feelings. And most factual explanation is transmedicalism, which is the idea that transsexualism is a diagnosable mental disorder called gender dysphoria. There\\'s science to back this up, it\\'s accepted by medical professionals, and it clearly explains why we are valid, unlike Rachel Dolezal, and snowflake-gender teenagers, and people who identify as cats. - Okay, I see the appeal. But I don\\'t think transmedicalism is as validating as you think it is. - Why not? - I\\'ll put it bluntly. Why does having gender dysphoria make you a woman? - Because gender dysphoria means I have a female brain. - No it doesn\\'t. I\\'m sorry to tell you but the science does not say what you think it says. There may be neurological causes of gender dysphoria, but at the end of the day all dysphoria is is discomfort in a male body, or a male social role, or however you want to put it. And wanting to be a woman is not the same thing as being a woman, not by any means. - Girl where are you going with this? What is this, are you becoming a TERF? - No I just don\\'t think your theory actually validates our womanhood. - Well if you\\'re right, that\\'s a real problem, because we need to have reason and science and logic and facts on our side so that we can explain to society that we\\'re valid, and that we\\'re real, otherwise, bad things. - Maybe there\\'s a better theory. - Well okay Socrates let\\'s hear it then. - The way I see it, gender is either psychological, or biological, or social. Now my friend Tabby, the catgirl, she thinks it\\'s all psychological, that it\\'s just identity, that whatever you think about your gender is true. And that makes me really uncomfortable, because then what\\'s the difference between identifying as a woman and identifying as a Norwegian Forest Cat? It\\'s a difference that Tabby herself seems not to have much of a grip on. - Girl that\\'s literally what I\\'ve been trying to tell you about transtrenders this entire time. - Just lemme finish. If gender is strictly biological then that\\'s game over for trans people. Unless you make some kind of wrong-brain-in-the-wrong-body argument but I told you I\\'m not buying that. So that leaves gender as a social construct. - Are you gonna try to make me read Judith Butler again? - I\\'ll summarize it. Gender is a series of gestures. It\\'s called performativity. It\\'s the way you dress, it\\'s the way you speak, it\\'s the way you act, it\\'s the way you relate to other people. Through transitioning we habituate to the gestures of womanhood, and socially that makes us women, regardless of biology or psychology, checkmate transphobes. - Okay, the problem with that is it\\'s both too exclusionary and too inclusive. It excludes a lot of trans people who can\\'t transition for circumstantial reasons but whose dysphoria is very real. And it includes every transtrender, drag queen, fetishist, and two-bit cross dressing comedian in a Dynel wig. - Uh, well. - Do you really believe that a man who plays a woman onstage becomes just as much of a woman as you and me? - Yes? - Bitch no you don\\'t. - Yeah you\\'re right I\\'m full of shit. - I know you are. Because you\\'re an SJW. And SJWs hate the performativity theory almost as much as they hate me. - Well they only hate it because they don\\'t understand it. They think it invalidates non-binary identities but in fact it\\'s the most rational way to explain non-binary identities. - How can you perform a non-binary identity? - Simple. You learn the rules so you can break them. Wearing a beard and a dress communicates ambiguity. Even the gesture of declaring, \"I am neither a man or a woman\" is a speech act that removes the speaker from the semantics of- - Girl shut up. This is too much philosophizing, I can\\'t stand it anymore. Why don\\'t you tell me what\\'s really going on with you. Why do you look like you\\'ve been in a k-hole for a week? Why are are you suddenly so obsessed with white-knighting for non-binary people? - Because I am non-binary. - No, you\\'re not. What are you talking about? - I just feel like since I started transitioning I\\'ve been trying so hard to fit in, and to perform my gender, and to pass, and to just be normal. But I can\\'t do it anymore. I just cannot make it work. I feel like an actor, I feel like a zombie, like I\\'m just going through the motions of this new gender role that\\'s supposed to liberate me but that\\'s somehow just as empty as the old one. Because I\\'m just not normal Tiffany. I\\'m a freak, and I\\'m always gonna be a freak. - Justine, you\\'re not non-binary, you\\'re gay. And everyone can see this except you. - Oh come on. I\\'m not gay. - Justine was extremely gay. Protest though the lady may, there simply is no stopping gayness. - I love catgirls! I hate catgirls but I also love them! - O abominable fate. - Okay so I\\'m a little bit gay. - Right and you don\\'t know how to reconcile your attraction to women with your desire to perform your gender. That\\'s why you feel this dissonance. - Yeah I guess that\\'s basically it. - Well it really shouldn\\'t be that hard girl. You already came out as a woman. Just blurt it out. Say \"Hello world, my name is Justine and I f*ck pussy.\" - That\\'s a very cisnormative way to- - Say it! - Hello world, my name is Justine and I f*ck pussy? Ugh, I feel like a man when I say it. - Yeah well you should probably buy a pickup truck then. Get some of those mudflaps on the back with like the little sexy ladies on them. And you may as well change your name back to Justin. - Okay, well that\\'s just uncalled for. - Girl I don\\'t know what to say except I told you so. Sexuality is just like gender identity. It is not a performance, it\\'s not a trend, it\\'s not a choice. It\\'s just part of who you are and there\\'s nothing you can do to change it. - I guess you\\'re right. I guess my theory sucks. - It sucks so f*cking hard. But the good news is you can unclench your asshole now and do whatever you want because you\\'re still a woman whether you\\'re performing a stereotype or not. So run free Justine. Go top a cis woman. Bang a gay guy. Wear some over-sized flannel. Do whatever you want. - Wow, yeah I guess that is pretty liberating. - Yeah thank God for transmedicalism right? Oh except not because you just destroyed transmedicalism with facts and logic so we have no theory. We have no theory, Justine. What do we do now? How do we prove we\\'re valid? - Well just do what every trans woman has done since time. Go out and f*ck the most brutally heterosexual man you can find and be validated in come. - Oh honey I have and I will. But that\\'s not gonna convince anyone but me. It\\'s not a proof, it\\'s not a theory. - Well maybe we don\\'t need a theory. Maybe we don\\'t need to prove anything. - Bad things, Justine, bad things! - Well do we have a theory about why people are gay? No. They just are. The only reason we even feel like we need a theory about trans people is that society is so unaccepting of us that it\\'s constantly demanding we justify our own reality. - Okay, so what am I supposed to tell Jackie Jackson then? What am I supposed to tell the TERFs? That I\\'m a woman because reasons? - No, not even because reasons. Just because you are. - So it\\'s what, a leap of faith? Oh great. I\\'m sure that\\'s gonna convince all the rational skeptics. Justine, it makes us sound completely delusional. - Well Tiffany, delusion is what separates us from the animals. Who do you think built the pyramids and the cathedrals? Clearly not people with a perfectly rational worldview. But why do you care anyway? Aren\\'t you the one who thinks being trans is a mental disorder? - Well I wouldn\\'t describe it as the height of sanity. But I would prefer to think that my whole life and identity is based on something I can rationally explain. - Well what are we Tiffany, men? Isn\\'t the single most obnoxious thing about men that they think they have to wrap up the entire world in a little rational box? Maybe the most important things in life can\\'t be logically proved. Can you logically prove that you love your own children? No. And the attempt to prove it is as degrading as it is futile. Maybe gender identity is one of those things. - Okay, but then how do I prove I\\'m more valid than Baltimore Maryland and the stargenders and the catpeople? - Well maybe we should stop getting so caught up in proving our validity to ourselves that we end up being horribly cruel to other people. What if we just accept all the freaks of the world? At the end of the day maybe it\\'s just not as important to have logical proofs as it is to be empathetic, and open-minded, and compassionate. ♪ Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya ♪ ♪ Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya ♪ Tiffany. ♪ Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya ♪ ♪ Kumbaya ♪ I have something to tell you. - Here it comes. - I love you. - Okay, well I\\'m gonna get going now. I have an important date drinking vodka cranberries and reading YouTube comments by myself, so I\\'d really better go do that. But, uh, good luck with your new life as a male lesbian who f*cks cats. - (scoffs) - Oh, are you upset? - Just go. - I\\'m sorry. (upbeat music) - I hate this bitch. But God she\\'s a yum yum. (soft music) - Hearken children, in this vision ye have witnessed mortal fools upon the screen, fools who do not love themselves. But I, your Goddess, Mother, Queen, messiah, I am nothing like them. For I am truth, I am light, I ended capitalism, and everything I tweet is woke. But most importantly I love myself. I love myself so much it makes me wet, it makes me come. Praise be unto me, hallelujah, like comment and subscribe, amen. (soft bang) (thoughtful music)',\n",
       " 8: \" my face is the front of shop my face is the real shop front my shop is the fixer front I'm real when I shut my face [Music] hey guys it's Natalie welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna do a makeup tutorial as always but first storytime storytime storytime I just want to be upfront with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery I'm always gonna be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean so much to me like you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story my whole entire journey this journey I've been on as a transgender woman you've been with me on this whole journey this is my truth and you've accepted the truth of my journey as a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just as special because you've been here for me throughout my whole transgender your message of my journey as a vulnerable servant of it's just been so an explosion lighter and the terms are guarantees America [Music] I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel as that makeup is a lot of fun but it's inner beauty that really counts anyway let's talk about plastic surgery I had a facial feminization surgery on April 2nd so about a month and a half ago what we call a facial feminization surgery or ffs is actually a series of different procedures that some transgender women choose to have to look more feminine so what I had done is forehead contouring a brow lift a rhinoplasty mandible contouring a trachea shave you know what let's just how the skull ad talk you through it a coronal incision was made a swatch the cranial vote whence the skin of the forehead was stripped away from the bone a fragment of the supraorbital Ridge was then chiseled away removed reshaped and Rhea fixed thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow but oftimes distinguishes this skull of the Chad a second decision was made with warts the columellar of the nasal septum facilitating the reconstruction of the Interior cartilage and bone further incisions were made between the gum and cheek through which the mandible was rasped and shaved down to a grace I'll curvature a jaw and pointed chin thereby delineating a facial silhouette exhibiting that aspect which medical men called Conte it all sounds pretty gruesome when you describe it like that but there's actually a very fine level of technique and aesthetics involved my plastic surgeon is an artist the results are natural I don't look like I've had a bunch of work done which is good you know you at least want to leave people wondering maybe she's born with it maybe a surgeon killed her face off and fixed her shitty skull here's it before and after picture where you can clearly see the difference T is the exact medical terminology my brows on fleek my nose is no longer busted the house my jaw snatched and my Adam's apple is cancelled wasn't it always really Eve's Apple may be Satan's Apple I think I still look like myself it's not a new face we're talking about millimeters of bone here but to have all that done was well it costs a lot of money the anticipation was a terror like I've never known the pain was rabble and the recovery took more than a month in fact I still have some swelling in my jowls cowls there's a nice feminine sounding word love that the standard YouTube tea girl thing to do of course would have been to vlog the whole journey storytime my facial surgery experience my ffs journey and post constant social media updates about it and I am grateful to the trans woman who have done that because it was really helpful to me to be able to watch those vlogs in advance and know what I was getting myself into but I decided not to post about the surgery because I wanted privacy for the recovery and to just take some time to get to feel at home with the results before subjecting myself to the vicious things they say about me and the tabloids you know I think I've been kind of psychologically damaged by reading for years the things people say about my appearance online and I'm not even talking about the haters like at this point I can mostly brush them off but for instance about a year ago I was reading through a transgender subreddit and some trans woman was ionizing about her appearance and someone offered the encouragement you know you can still look hot even if you don't pass just look at contra points oh like a dagger to the horror the unintentional shade of it all so the past six weeks have been at times difficult and lonely but I did manage to keep my mug off social media for long enough that I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be for the commentary of the Internet so bring it on you jackals you vultures you Goblin swine well I was lying around bandaged and bored I did have a lot of time to think and what I've been thinking about is probably the same thing you're wondering right now which is why would someone do what I just did why would I spend so much time and money and go through so much anxiety and pain just to change a few millimeters of bone isn't this all just extravagant vanity some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much well I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me to say that in fact this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all usually trans people say that surgery is like facial feminization top surgery general reassignment and so on served the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria this discomfort we feel with the mismatch between our bodies and our gender identity so what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery was a medically necessary reconstructive procedure needed to make my testosterone whether facial bones match the five-foot-two happy baby bouncy bio girl I truly am inside thereby alleviating my dysphoria helping me safely blend into society and preventing a five-alarm psychiatric meltdown and there is definitely truth to that it's certainly the argument I intend to make when I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes if you're an IRS auditor please stop this video now and insert the next floppy disk into your CD Drive but hypothetically speaking I think the reality might not be quite as simple how sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria from the other kinds of body image dysphoria that drives cisgender people to get cosmetic surgery all the time last year when I used to foolishly tweet things of substance I tweeted that I wanted to get ffs and some trans people responded telling me that I was suffering from internalized transphobia and self-loathing they compared it to East Asian people getting double eyelid surgery or so-called ethnic rhinoplasty which they say are motivated by internalized racism and Western beauty standards I think that's a pretty weak analogy and telling a trans person to just learn to accept the way they look can actually be kind of transphobic because a big part of what it even means to be trans at least for me the desire to look more female but I also think trans people often talk like gender dysphoria is this intrinsic personal experience that's always 100% valid and never has anything at all to do with the external pressure of beauty standards but in fact gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum away from the influence of societal ideals and norms early in my transition some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair so I had full body laser hair removal and now I'm smoother than a cisgender boiled egg but where does the idea that women don't have body hair come from isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom a lot of this is women I know don't so much as a shave their legs so maybe I'm not even trying to look like a sis woman maybe I'm simply doing everything I can to avoid looking like the caricature of a knuckly hairy bird mannish trans woman with which society has terrorized me to my core is this gender dysphoria or is it internalized transphobia or is it simply a cosmetic preference when I try to psychoanalyze myself I find that my desire is to look female to look feminine and to look beautiful are not exactly the same but they're woven together so tightly that it's kind of difficult to untangle them and the opposite is also true that for me feeling mannish or dysphoric usually goes along with feeling ugly I don't have a lot of days where I walk out the house thinking well I'm giving femme queen realness but apart from that I look like absolute [ __ ] of course there are qualities that make you look female that aren't necessarily attractive like cellulite or flabby arms which are super fish but aren't deemed beautiful by society the truth is I don't just want to look female I want to be beautiful desperately God will do anything and evening in this video I want to explore why I'm so obsessed with being beautiful and why it seems like a lot of people who live in a society we're so obsessed is it phones I know you're supposed to pretend that you don't care about being beautiful or that you're not trying but guys it's the only thing I care about and I've never tried so hard anything of course I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it because there is this idea that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain you know smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty and I've always been categorized as a smart person by people around me some of that is when you're raised like I was as a middle-class white boy with no athletic talent parents and teachers treat you like a [ __ ] genius like Einstein nutted a load in Mozart's Buzzi and Mozart shot you out while he was getting a rusty trombone from Vincent van Gogh it inspired his famous painting starfish Knight but even among women caring about beauty is often frowned upon I feel like an alien species when I hang out with women in academia and I know a few because I once got half a PhD before dropping out to become a what do you call someone who makes videos a cam girl most female grad students and professors I know don't wear makeup to them the idea of earnestly putting on press-on nails or false eyelashes is inconceivable like maybe on Halloween now part of that is that women in male-dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to present more masculine to be taken seriously because of this prejudice that beautified femininity equals frivolous but another part is clearly some kind of not like other girls weird flux which okay fine whatever I'm not going to judge another woman for the way she cooks with a society that pressures women to be beautiful while simultaneously belittling them for caring about it I guess my way of coping is this tacky heteronormative and tragically sincere aspiration to some kind of post ironic feminine beauty why am I like this well part of it is vindictive transsexualism pure and simple to all the people who have ever called me a man I want to say [ __ ] you by looking like the undeniable visual archetype of a woman which is a beautiful feminine woman who's wearing six hundred thousand sequins their biological sequence oh that is some an Samaras right there inside [Music] another factor is this shitty website I'm a professional YouTube influencer forgive me father and I'm on camera all the time I edit my own videos so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month staring at my own face on a screen now you try doing that and see what kind of [ __ ] up complex you develop plus I compare myself to other women who make videos a lot of the trans women on YouTube are so young and so beautiful it makes me want to throw up and in comparison for a long time I felt like this shabby aging transvestite just this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store so I'm insecure I'm compensating for that whole mess but I honestly don't present the beautiful people I really just stand the hell out of them I follow this woman on YouTube and I want to be just like her mom her name is named Jefferson Starr her name is Lady Jayne MacLean senior on Nicole Bethany Jade tutorials tatyana petrov NatWest Ricola and of course my queen and perfect goddess human sty Stan and whose portrait I've painted hundreds of times so there's maybe some extra intensity for me but I think it's actually pretty normal to want to be beautiful I think you even grad students want to be beautiful they just want to do it in that Becky kind of way will you scoff at anything glam or artificial and it's not just women who care about beauty either I mean gay men in LA I've always been getting cosmetic surgery but now even the straights are doing it in cells are completely obsessed with the defects of their personal appearance and the ones who are completely black pilled are obsessed with plastic surgery the in cell news speak word for beauty is looks maxing because of course they have to go about this in the most heterosexual possible way it is imperative in from the skin max regimen in order to maximize looks money status and secure access to females oh my god calm Dion not every sentence out of your mouth has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner yes they actually call skin care skin max James Charles I know you're having a hard month but I've got a business idea that's gonna turn this thing around for you here's a plan you're gonna create a new line of skincare products called Chad glow bribe Beauty pie to send its fans to the promo video hi sister cells and send me a check in the mail you're welcome if you read looks max forums they're filled with discussions of brow Ridge implants chin implants mandible implants it a must need remark that the skull of the Chad exhibited a jawbone most robust it's literally facial masculinization surgery so everyone's obsessed with the bones everyone's obsessed with beauty whether man or woman cysts or trans gay or gamer maybe lesbians are just straight chillin well everyone else has completely lost their minds but why why do we care so much but within cells by their own account the only reason they care is they think that looks maxing will make females have sex with them and I think of that will make their lives feel meaningful which it will not so in cells are cancelled now what about women what's our deal what's our sitch what's our vibe what's our veg well man seem to think that women are like inverted in cells that we care about beauty and wear makeup fake up because we're trying to attract men my daddy Don Juan on Vice news last year and said that women wear makeup because they're trying to stimulate male sexual arousal and because evolution now there is a go being bratty I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false for one thing straight men don't like makeup at least they don't think they do here's a chart I made illustrating what every straight man in the world thinks about makeup yes I asked all of them if you wear no makeup they think you look diseased and I actually do look diseased when I don't wear makeup so fair enough if you were a natural makeup you know a little concealer or mascara maybe a nude lip they think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it if you wear a county makeup colorful eye shadow heavy contouring overdrawn lips they think it's dumb and they hate it of course I'm generalizing hashtag not all daddy Thomas but if women really wore may go to attract man then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing it when there are no men around but that doesn't happen about a month ago there was that video going around of a woman showing how to make a jailhouse makeup mixing deodorant and magazine inked make eyeshadow using kool-aid and Vaseline to make a lipstick there's not a lot of man in women's prison but women are still performing incredible feats of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup so maybe women are using makeup to express their individuality and femininity you know things that Prison tries to take away from you kind of makes sense there's a refinery29 documentary about prison cosmetology and also sexual exploitation yikes in which of inmate describes how women would engage in sexual bartering with male guards just to get makeup if a girl's performing sexual favors from an officer he would bring her in colored pencils lipgloss things like that that's right women are a sucking dick so they can put on makeup not the other way around honestly if all the men died tomorrow off I definitely keep wearing makeup in fact I might wear more and I'm not just saying that cuz I'm trying to win feminist points or anything like do I want to attract man yes of course I do do I want to a chart to women I guess I don't really think about it isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside whatever it's fine I want to attract a non-binary people to of course but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender so how dare you the point is when I think about my appearance wanting to attract people to have sex with is not the main thing going through my head what is going through my head I guess I just want to feel beautiful I want to see myself in the mirror and think I look snotch is that a crime I don't feel pretty very often I'd say it happens about once a month I'm having a good skin day I do my makeup just right like a listen with setting spray and that happens a tingle goes up my spine I am Botticelli I am van Gogh I have created Beauty I'm a girl and then it's over that's it for a month you really want to look in the mirror I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not like with other people I can just look at them and instantly make a judgement about it but with myself I have to just guess it's the same as being a trans person trying to figure out whether you pass would you clock me I'd clock me I'd [ __ ] me - I don't give a [ __ ] get out of my room mom it doesn't work like that for me I have to rely on other people's feedback of course the problem with other people's feedback is that people are liars you look great on especially when those people are your fans what's the house Queen some of my throat mother I'll die for you oh my god or when they're your haters you're disgusting a giant collarbone Nazi was a man out of thousand paces I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not but I can estimate like I have figured out that I'm too pretty for Twitter but I'm not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram it's hard being a six I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water before my surgery I got into a pretty good rhythm of posting my shitty little makeup looks and what I find an addictive about it is this constant flow of positive comments from other people even though I know it's mostly flattery you invented beauty perfect angel choke me Mommy every time I could a comment like that I'm perfectly aware that it's wild exaggeration fueled by parasocial delusions but I still get a head of dopamine in my biologically female brain and the intoxicating thing about Instagram is that the embellishment of the truth is a two-way street thanks to the miracle of facetune yes we finally get to talk about the phones see it's a black mirror because it's a window into the darkness of the human soul got it should I explain it again bones live in a society facetune is an app that lets you fix all the problems with your face so here's an unedited pre ffs picture of me what I would do in face tune is smooth out the complexion shrink the nose a little bring the jaw in and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop it's really no more drastic than the kinds of photo doctoring people have been doing since the invention of photography what's changed is that now everyone is doing it to their own photos every day and I've noticed that when I'm in the habit of editing my flaws out of pictures what I look at an unedited picture of myself or I look in the mirror my eyes go straight to the flaws why are my pores so big why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop Venice is this really a good use of my mental energy here comes that guilt again instead of worrying about my pores shouldn't I be helping stop the impending climate catastrophe that it's gonna destroy the planet if we don't change the economy in like 12 years she I guess it's 11 years now it's just hard to focus on climate change when there's so much else on my mind he's just so cute I guess I just rather think about the aesthetic and the apocalypse and that's the darkness why is my neck like two decades older than the rest of my skin 20 Botox yeah should I get a facelift these are the questions that will no doubt defined the next couple decades of my life as if it wasn't bad enough to have to go through a second adolescence on camera I also have to deal with aging and thus the ritual of skincare products here's my daytime routine so first I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator with the cleansing gel and just massage my face none of this is sponsored by the way this is just me supporting corporations out of the kindness of my heart now if I'm not running late for something I will do a face mask but if I'm out of bed it's because I'm running late for something so I've never done a face mask now I'm gonna use a toner which is very important now a lot of people don't know what a toner does but look at tones okay do you want your face to be unknown next I'm gonna spray expensive Korean yeast directly into my eyes I use this because it's actually a lot cheaper than the Japanese yeast so you're really losing money if you don't buy it think of the savings now I'm gonna mix a pump of hyaluronic acid with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water you can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields it's enchanting it's like I'm there there's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather I use this moisturizer because Gigi gorgeous told me to and I do everything Gigi says I know it seems like a lot of products but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can and I feel like I'm forgetting something a sunscreen I'm not really sure what this does we can probably skip it and I'm just gonna finish it all off with some more expensive mist yes god I love a good facial I am so [ __ ] wet right now so after all these products does my skin look clearer younger more toned well it's hard to say for sure but it certainly is moist this is the part where I usually just stare at my own face for ten minutes and contemplate the futility of my struggle against the ravages of time I'm fine that's fits fine this is fine it's fine [Music] vanitas Vanette heart'll @ omnia vanitas for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return leastwise i shall bequeath a female skull so isn't beauty supposed to be fun I'm not having fun right now why am I not having fun I guess I just don't feel beautiful and I know a lot of people think I'm pretty and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me and I know I should be grateful and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery and I know I shouldn't care so much about this in the first place but the truth is that this just eats away at me and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain I've been kind of depressed to this past month and I think part of it is that on a subconscious level I think I was hoping that surgery would completely change my self-image and make me like myself but it really hasn't I mean I'm happy with the results I'd do it all again but I still feel the way I felt before you have to keep in mind that surgery fixes very specific problems like the Adam's apple problem or the way my forehead looks in profile problem but it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues I still don't feel beautiful and I need to face the fact that I'm never going to feel beautiful unless I change the way I think because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here and if I'm ever gonna get out I think I need to start by forgiving myself for wanting to be beautiful there's lots of reasons to want to be beautiful besides being a shallow and vain for one beauty is associated with youth it's a symbol of life of defiance of death that's a profound thing to be concerned about see I'm not a bimbo I'm a poet beauty is also associated with moral worth the beautiful princess versus the evil hag there's studies showing that conventionally attractive people are more likely to be assumed to be happy healthy and trustworthy they're more likely to be hired so it's not just about Instagram likes this is serious stuff and we the woke we're all aware of this we know that beauty is power that beauty is political we know that beauty standards come from the people with privilege in an unequal Society we know it's unjust that being light-skinned assists able-bodied or thin is considered more attractive than being dark-skinned trans disabled or 5 we know that female beauty matters so much because patriarchy we know that our obsession with beauty is being provoked by advertising the cosmetic industry and beauty influencers who are trying to sell as products we know we know we know all this because we've all been sitting around critiquing it for decades because that's what leftists do we critique things we are finely tuned detectors of racism sexism ableism fatphobia transphobia and capitalism Ronnie Mack we notice an injustice we problematize it we critique it and then we cancel it but what's next when we're done critiquing things what are we supposed to do because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards are a racist sexist ablest fad phobic transphobic social construct designed to preserve power relations and sell products but does that awareness mean I desire any less to be conventionally beautiful well no I want am more than ever the problem is that the intellectual exercise of critiquing things doesn't usually affect my desires very much so what am I supposed to do sit here in silent contemplation until my desires finally align themselves with the interests of the International proletarian revolution oh [ __ ] the revolution I want to be a pretty rich girl I don't want to be content to be GG gorgeous fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea I came up with when I was a male alcoholic unfortunately America needs the Contra points right now more than it needs a thirty-year-old GG gorges impersonator so I guess I'm stuck with it maybe it's for the best critiquing a society may not change our desires but it can motivate us to change society and changing society can change our desires so how do we change society revolution well sure revolution depending on what happens in 2020 I'll think of grabbing a brick myself but failing that I thinks there are ways we can work to loosen the grip of restrictive beauty standards without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look I do think representation matters and I think having a visible Beauty icons who are dark-skinned or trans or gender non-conforming or disabled or fat or over 35 or influencers makes a big difference Beauty standards are social constructs and social constructs can change that's why it's so important to recognize that influencers are just as valid as other celebrities for the promise changing society is that it takes a long time in this video is almost over where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty you can be stylish at any age you can be stylish whether you pass or not style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic that you have complete control over it's like art and that originality is a virtue style is an individual aesthetic unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards as the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so even if you don't conform to conventional beauty standards through the power of original style you can create the taste by which your unique beauty is to be appreciated society may frown upon us six-foot [ __ ] but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is smudged I can easily abide any comment and he stare I can be misgendered a Dairy Queen for all I care it does not matter I can strut with confidence because I am basking in the regal knowledge of my own aesthetic superiority bow before me peasants I proclaim to the drive-through window for I am serving a lurk so I guess that's the solution I can't believe I single-handedly added capitalism now does that mean I'm not gonna get a lot of expensive plastic surgery [ __ ] no what do you people think I am some kind of transgender mother Teresa god damned the audacity of you people the hubris look I need plastic surgery because I have no style in fact after the month had you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all so that's it for me I guess I have nothing but the decay of time and age to look forward to I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth and cultivating kindness intelligence and inner beauty you gross [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm drooling all over myself because my jaw is still numb from the surgery left I\",\n",
       " 9: ' - On the day that The Female Eunuch was issued in America, a person in flapping draperies rushed up to me and grabbed my hand. Thank you, it breathed hoarsely, thank you so much for all you\\'ve done for us girls! I smirked and nodded and stepped backward, trying to extricate my hand from the enormous, knuckley, hairy, be-ringed paw that clutched it. The face staring into mine was thickly coated with a pancake make-up through which the stubble was already burgeoning, in futile competition with a Dynel wig of immense luxuriance and two pairs of false eyelashes. Against the bony ribs that could be counted through its flimsy scarf dress swung a polished steel women\\'s liberation emblem. I should have said, you\\'re a man. The Female Eunuch has done less than nothing for you. Piss off. (\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\") Let\\'s go adult human females. (\"Waltz of the Sugar Plum Fairies\") First of all, a reminder that this video is a female-only space. So if there are any men here today, get out! I mean, unless you enjoy secretly watching the very interesting things that women do on our own, in which case, like, comment, subscribe! So look, it\\'s 2019, I think most people have heard about TERFs, trans-exclusionary radical feminists. You know, these fanatics like Germaine Greer who call trans women it and think that trans men are lost lesbian sisters. You guys know about trans men, right? Male-to-female is not the only type of transgender person. There\\'s also people who were born, well, people who were assigned, people who were always, people who identify. TERFs don\\'t like being called TERFs, they think it\\'s a term of disparagement, which, it is. They call themselves radical feminists, RadFems or lately, gender critical. The idea is that gender femininity, masculinity, gender roles, all that, it\\'s all a patriarchal construct, and biological sex is the only thing that makes a person a man or a woman. In the past on this channel, I\\'ve always caricatured TERFs as being like angry, man-hating bigots, whose only real tactic is accusing trans women of being creepy men. And there definitely are some people who are really like that, but I want to be fair, I want to be balanced, so in preparation to make this video, I posted an invitation on Twitter asking people who used to be gender critical feminists to share their stories with me. And I got hundreds of responses, a lot of them from women who have had traumatic experiences with men and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender where women and men are completely separate species, where women are safe and men are dangerous. And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people into their picture of the world at first challenged their sense of stability and comfort. It was difficult emotional work, work that they needed to do, but still difficult. And that makes total sense to me, like it\\'s very easy for me to understand why someone would feel that way. So it\\'s not just evil bigots who are attracted to the gender critical worldview. And in this video, I don\\'t want to just parody TERFs. This time, I want to really engage with gender critical ideas in the public arena of free speech open communication dialogue conversation debate idea marketplace expression discourse. Maybe I\\'ll even get in touch with my inner RadFem. She\\'s a little shy, sure, but she\\'s here, not queer, reads a lot of Germaine Greer. And when I am having a dark night of the soul, sweaty, she\\'s feeling XXtra biological and when the full moon shines she speaks. (\"Waltz of the Sugar Plum Fairies\") Ugh, this is agony. I\\'m a biological woman trapped in the body of a male narcissist. Can you imagine? Okay, so she\\'s a little out of touch, sure, but she\\'s not a bigot, you know, I\\'m sure she doesn\\'t hate trans people, she just has a few concerns. You know, it\\'s like you\\'re not even allowed to ask questions anymore or you\\'re accused of transphobia. We\\'re all just expected to conform to this gender ideology that we the public never got a chance to debate. We didn\\'t vote for trans orthodoxy, yet here we are permitting biological males to run rampant in women\\'s spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous dogma that girls can become boys with a change of costume. Oh, it rattles my chromosomes! She goes on like that for hours. It\\'s like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator shaft with the ghost of Anita Bryant. Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is? Do you have any idea how many decades I fought for your rights? Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead? Scholars remain divided. It does seem like it\\'s getting harder to have conversations about difficult topics. You know, our children are coming of age in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face consequences for simply having a politically incorrect opinion about the Jewish question. It\\'s PC run A-mok, it\\'s a Hannuhkatastrophe! Problematic banter aside, the current discourse about transgender issues is an explosion of untreated sewage. We have far-right politicians menacing us with legal discrimination and erasure, we have fear-mongering and hostility in the press and that, combined with high rates of family rejection and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive. So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing, and shield ourselves behind simple, unambiguous slogans. Trans women are women! Which is true, we are women. But, that was a sinister but, watch out for that. What happens is that people who don\\'t really understand trans issues, in other words most people, have lots of unanswered questions about the details. And in particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory, but not trans feminism, might wonder things like, how can you be a woman without the oppression experiences of girlhood? Why can\\'t you just be a feminine man instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes? Why are misogynistic gender ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression? Trans people don\\'t like engaging with these questions because most of the time they\\'re just brandished as weapons against us. You know, it\\'s like when a man asks \"If society \"is so sexist against women, \"then why is it that men \"are 97% of combat fatalities, feminazis?\" Like, you could sit there for three hours trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal, but wouldn\\'t you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks? Because nine times out of 10, that guy doesn\\'t give a shit about combat fatalities, he\\'s just trolling you to shut down whatever actual point you were making. And the same goes for people telling me, you sure do like wearing nails and makeup, is that all you think there is to being a woman? Could you define womanhood for me? Like, they don\\'t actually care, they\\'re just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes. But if you really are sincerely wondering about the answer to these troll questions and many people are, then you actually need fairly complicated and nuanced answers. Which is why they make good troll questions because they waste a lot of your time. In this video, I want to take at face value the questions and concerns associated with gender critical hostility to trans people and I want to try to give nuanced answers rather than dogmatic ones. Now, the problem with being nuanced is that it\\'s hard, so I might f*ck something up. And a lot of trans people want me to represent them absolutely perfectly, so if I do f*ck something up, well, just read me to filth on Twitter like you always do, you little shits, love you! Let\\'s watch an instructional video to learn more. - Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman? We have 13 beautiful women on our show today, only the catch is that some of them are actually men. - Oops, wrong channel. Concern one, gender metaphysics. - There\\'s no such thing as a man trapped in a woman\\'s body. There are no pink brains and blue brains. Just because you want to be a woman, doesn\\'t mean you are one. This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense. - Trans people often use metaphorical language to describe feelings that are difficult to put into words and that\\'s how I understand the \"trapped in the wrong body\" language. Is there literally such a thing as a male soul trapped in a female body or vice versa? I don\\'t personally believe there is, but I\\'m a little biased, I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit. As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting a correlation between binary transgender identity and cross-sex brain anatomy, but the evidence really doesn\\'t justify claims about female brains in male bodies or anything like that. Brain differences between men and women are statistical averages of things like gray and white matter density, not as the term female brain implies, distinct anatomical structures likes penises and vaginas. So personally I don\\'t believe in any gender metaphysics at all. I\\'m kind of an unorthodox trans person, so much for the unquestionable dogma of the trans cult in that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man, rather than as having always been a woman. But it\\'s important to remember that while I may not fit the typical profile, I am not real and not valid. But in any case, I live as a woman now, and that\\'s kind of just what\\'s happening whether you like or not so I\\'m not sorry? My view is well-expressed by Catherine MacKinnon. \"I always thought I don\\'t care how someone \"becomes a woman or a man; it does not matter to me. \"Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, \"is going around being a woman, as far as I\\'m concerned, \"is a woman.\" Concern two, gender stereotypes. - What do you mean you live as a woman? You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes by putting on makeup, nails, and a fake girly voice. - Listen, sweaty, first of all, my girly voice is very f*cking real. Second, my clothes, makeup, voice, none of this makes me a woman. No trans woman thinks that femininity and womanhood are the same. Rather, we\\'re using a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are. Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends don\\'t really understand why I\\'m presenting in such a meticulously feminine way. Like, they think I\\'m wearing ombre lips at 11 a.m. because I\\'m playing some kind of clout game, which I am, but also if one person calls me sir, that\\'s gonna ruin my day, so I\\'m desperately throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood. I think butch or gender non-conforming cis women sometimes side-eye hyper-feminine trans women because they don\\'t identify with this vision of womanhood at all and they\\'ve had to struggle since childhood against a society that\\'s told them they have to be feminine. And I completely sympathize with that. I think there should be more gender freedom, less coercion, less restriction. But also, I\\'ve had to fight against the same society that told me I should really, really, really, not be this, so, I feel like we should be able to form some kind of solidarity here. Concern three, abolish gender. - But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs of masculinity and femininity, not conforming to them. Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it. - Abolish gender? Well that sounds like an ambitious project for one transsexual, but I mean I\\'ll give it a try. (snaps) Solanus be praised. No nails, no makeup, I\\'m wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment. I did it everyone, I abolished gender. Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier, so I should probably get rid of that. (gong rings) How is she though? She\\'s feeling a little genderless. I guess the way I position my body is still gendered and there\\'s a gendered cadence to my voice. So what I\\'m gonna do is just hold my hands up genderlessly and speak in a genderless robot voice. My name is 5466417 I have no gender. Patriarchy is over. I guess English is still patriarchal language, right? So I should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds. (imitating robot) I can\\'t stand this, f*ck this. Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea, like, wouldn\\'t it be better if your genitals at birth didn\\'t determine what kind of life you could live? But that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change, kind of like abolish borders. Your utopian pipe dream is valid! And denying trans people their gender identity because abolish gender is kind of like denying citizenship to immigrants because abolished borders. Like, you\\'re targeting the people who are the most vulnerable under the present system and the leveraging that system against them under the pretense of abolishing it. You know, you don\\'t see gender critical feminists in Kim Kardashian\\'s Instagram comments like, \"Why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist. \"You should be abolishing gender, \"not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.\" No, they don\\'t attack the gender expression of people with power and influence. They\\'re all on Twitter, harassing some poor, newly out trans woman with 200 followers and calling her a creepy man and mocking her for being feminine ineptly or being too feminine or not being feminine enough. It\\'s almost like when they say abolish gender, what they really mean is abolish trans people. It\\'s almost like this is a hate movement hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist platitudes. But surely, I must be missing something. Concern four, male privilege. - It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement that you think you can just claim womanhood for yourself without living any of the struggle that entails. - So look, I\\'m a successful, white, middle-class trans woman. In the grand scheme of things, I\\'m really not very oppressed. I may not be the 1%, but I am the tra*ny 1%. So I don\\'t like to complain about every little microaggression I experience because under the circumstances, it just seems a little gauche. And I don\\'t like things that are gauche. But I\\'ve had cis feminists of my race and class tell me that I have no idea what it\\'s like to be talked over and interrupted by men. - [Man] Actually, Kropotkin. - Or to experience street harassment or to have to treat every first date like a potentially life-threatening situation and it\\'s just bizarre to me that they think that. Like, what do you think my experience in the world is? You think men treat me as their equal? You think street harassers are gonna treat me with dignity and respect because I have a Y chromosome? - Hey beautiful, where you going baby? Where you going? Oh, it\\'s a tr*nny. Excuse me, sir, my mistake. Please proceed freely to your destination. - Come on, people, use your heads. When you have Germaine Greer calling trans women it, what do you think the guy on the steps of the liquor store is gonna say? When a trans woman doesn\\'t pass, it\\'s not like society simply treats her like a man. No, you get treated as monster gender, pronouns \"it\" and \"spit\", and male privilege is not a good description of that experience at all. Once you start passing as a woman, it\\'s really a step up, even though women get treated bad, because it\\'s still better to be a \"she\" than an \"it.\" Now gender critical feminists are really skeptical of the whole notion of passing. They think they can always clock a tran and they assume everyone else can, too. But that\\'s just not reality. I mean, I\\'m only a year and a half into my transition and at this point, I\\'ve had zero surgeries and it\\'s been like six months since I was last misgendered offline. I mean, a person with a good eye for it will probably clock me and maybe a lot of people have just been indoctrinated into politically correct gender ideology, but like, you really think the gas station attendant and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy are all calling me miss and ma\\'am because of... postmodernism? I know some of you are gonna sneak off to your shitty little RadFem forums and obsess over how manly and clockable I am, but like at the end of the day, what am I gonna trust, the deranged hate-posting of 25 frothing anons or every social interaction I\\'ve had for months? I\\'m so sorry you can\\'t handle that I\\'m natural fish. I\\'m ahi tuna and you\\'re mackerel sweaty. Take a f*cking sip, babes. - [Theryn] I love that. Concern five, male socialization. - So you had a male upbringing, you never experienced the traumas of girlhood, you benefited from male privilege for decades, and now you think none of that matters? You are who you are because of how you were socialized, not because of how you dress. - Alright, it\\'s time to crack open the nuance. So on the one hand, you\\'re partially right. I have no idea what it\\'s like to be catcalled as a nine-year-old girl or what that does to a child\\'s psyche. That kind of thing didn\\'t start happening to me till I was an adult, when I knew what I was getting into and was ready for it. That\\'s very different from what cis women go through. My upbringing and adolescence has more in common with a typical man than a typical woman and many of the experiences from those days I simply can\\'t make sense of as female experiences. I absolutely benefited from male privilege and it did influence who I was and who I was in my late teens and early 20s was an anti-feminist shithead who had no idea what women go through and I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that. Because in trans discourse, it\\'s just accepted as obvious that trans men know what it\\'s like to be raised as women and to be influenced by those formative female experiences, but when it comes to the early life experiences of trans women, we\\'re supposed to say, \"When I was five years old, \"I loved wearing my mom\\'s high heels,\" or else say nothing at all. There\\'s that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath where she describes the way living as a woman stifles an adventurous spirit and her longing for a male experience. - [Narrator] \"Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle \"with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars \"to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording \"all this is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, \"a female always supposedly in danger \"of assault and battery. \"My consuming interest in men and their lives is often \"misconstrued as a desire to seduce them \"or as an invitation to intimacy. \"Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can. \"I want to be able to sleep in an open field, \"to travel west, to walk freely at night.\" - So I got to do all of that in my early 20s and what I discovered is I hate sleeping in open fields, I despise the west, and I\\'d really rather stay inside collecting ceramics and sucking dick. Now I\\'m not saying that makes me a woman and I\\'m not saying that Sylvia Plath is a man because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews for reasons that are inconceivable to me. What I am saying is that, when I hit my mid-20s and realized that I was inhabiting a gender, body, and sexual persona that were drastically wrong for me. And I tried every possible alternative to transitioning before realizing that I had an irrepressible need to become a woman. So I changed. And when I changed, society\\'s treatment of me changed. Socialization doesn\\'t end with childhood, it\\'s a lifelong process. For example, when I transitioned, my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers, and radical feminist haters started commenting on my physical appearance about 20 to 30 times more often and I had to get used to that being something that matters a lot more. That said, resocialization takes time, and sometimes, trans people early in transition have most of that process ahead of them. I also think we have to take into account the age at which a person transitions. Kim Petras, whomst we stan. - [Theryn] Oh, we stan. - We stan. - Oh, we stan. - I stan. Oh, we stan. She transitioned as a child and I imagine was socialized more or less the same as a cis woman. Whereas, Caitlyn Jenner, whomst, well, just whomst, she made millions of dollars in men\\'s sports, she had six children by three wives, transitioned in retirement at age 65, and told Buzzfeed that the hardest part of being a woman is figuring out what to wear. This is the only trans woman most people have heard of. It makes me want to cry. Like, I\\'m not saying Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman, but I am saying that anyone who wants to argue that male privilege hasn\\'t shaped her perspective, doesn\\'t have a leg to stand on. But also, trans women often don\\'t experience male socialization the way cis men do. Many trans women are feminine and queer before they transition, and have basically always experienced a kind of femmephobia that is rooted in misogyny. Some trans women also identified as women years before transitioning and internalized society\\'s messaging about women more than society\\'s messaging about men. Now that\\'s still not the same as living in society as a girl from birth, but it\\'s also pretty different from the socialization of masculine cis men. I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue that trans women never experience male privilege is that a lot TERFs use male privilege as a proxy for calling us men. - Pull up your zipper your, male privilege is hanging out. - I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point for many gender critical feminists is that there\\'s an element here of stolen valor, this sense of injustice that people are claiming their identity without experiencing their oppression. It reminds me of what in the trans community are called transmedicalists, people who insist the only real trans people are those who experience agonizing dysphoria. In both cases, there is a sense that the essential thing that confirms your identity is pain. What it is to be trans is to despise your body, what it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men. - You didn\\'t suffer like I\\'ve suffered. You don\\'t know what it\\'s like! - You know, I\\'m tempted to strike back by saying that you don\\'t know what it\\'s like to occupy an identity so stigmatized that most of the people who are attracted to you in private are too ashamed to admit it in public. You don\\'t know what it\\'s like to have a body so non-normative that you\\'re shut out of whole areas of society. I could go on, but this America\\'s Next Top Victim contest does nothing but to provoke infighting between trans women and cis women at a time when we should be marching side by side to destroy video games forever. #YesAllGamers. Concern six, reproductive oppression. - You don\\'t know what it\\'s like to grow up being shamed for your periods, to fear unwanted pregnancy, to have to fight for your right to abortion, to bear the pain of childbirth. - Well, yeah, that\\'s true. My inner RadFem sways in a gentle victorious samba. I do think it\\'s important for trans women to stand in solidarity with cis women on issues like period equity and abortion rights and to learn about the experiences of cis women to form a more complete understanding of the female condition. But of course, no individual woman experiences all the things women experience and individual women understand the meaning of womanhood in drastically different ways. For some women, having babies is the most essentially womanly experience. For others, maybe it\\'s having an abortion. I mean, not actually, but you know, TERFs pretend it is to own the tr*nnies. For me, it\\'s receiving 12-paragraph emails in my business inbox from married men struggling through the existential crisis of some kind of shemale-themed sexual awakening. - Also, do you want to be a guest on my podcast, Free Speech Radio? - But also, not all women experience their womanhood as essentially oppressive or centered around the pains of reproductive capacity. When Shania Twain sang \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" she wasn\\'t talking about having a coat hanger abortion in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga. Man, I feel like shit. (\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\") Concern seven, erasing female vocabulary. - Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss women\\'s bodies and women\\'s oppression. We\\'re now expected to talk about pregnant people and menstruators just to appease the gender ideologues. Well, I for one am not a menstruator, I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N and I will not be erased. - Okay, if you\\'ve heard the terms menstruator or pregnant people and are thinking, what the f*ck kind of Orwellian newspeak gender cuckoldry is that, take a deep breath, clear your mind, here\\'s the tea. Some medical organizations have recently begun using the term pregnant people instead of pregnant women. And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word \"menstruators\" in a Tweet about the repeal of a tampon tax. This has prompted some conservative, TERF, and Christian publications to post panicked commentaries warning that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased. But in fact, medical language that assumes that everyone with a uterus is a woman erases trans men or non-binary people who menstruate and get pregnant. So saying pregnant women in this context erases them, whereas saying pregnant people includes them and cis women and doesn\\'t erase anyone except for Cincinnatians because we all know they\\'re not people. Take your shitty chili elsewhere. - But I\\'m a woman, not a goddamn menstruator! What kind of misogynistic madness is it to reduce women to their capacity to bleed? - I actually agree with you that the word menstruator sounds pretty dehumanizing, And the trans men I\\'ve talked to about this aren\\'t really the biggest fans of it either. Sometimes it takes a while to settle on language that\\'s both inclusive and usable, and my prediction is that \"menstruators\" is a not gonna work out. Maybe \"people who menstruate?\" - But why can\\'t I just say woman, that\\'s what I am! - You can just say woman! That is what you are! No one is asking that you stop referring to yourself as a woman. Institutional medical language is designed to be inclusive and therefore impersonal. No one is proposing that we stop calling individual women pregnant women or expectant mothers. - Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed. I notice it\\'s only female anatomy you\\'re trying to erase. I notice you\\'re not suggesting doctors start saying \"people with prostates.\" - Oh, I am definitely suggesting that. - But trans activists are invading feminist spaces and telling women we can\\'t discuss our own bodies. I have no problem with cis feminists discussing or celebrating periods or wearing pussy hats at political marches or free bleeding all over the National Mall. I mean, someone has to. The National Mall is not gonna bleed on itself. I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate their reproductive anatomy in defiance of a society that routinely shames and subjugates them for it. The problem arises only when menstruation or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender trans men or exclude womz whomst doth not bleed. I mean, trans women do bleed, but only when we cut ourselves. ♪ No one knows what it\\'s like to be a sad tran ♪ Concern eight, TERF is a slur. - TERF is a slur designed to silence women. Nay, it is hate speech designed to incite violence against women. - The word TERF is a pejorative for a person who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism, but it\\'s not a slur. A slur is a pejorative that targets someone\\'s race, religion, gender, or sexuality. The word misogynist is pejorative. It has only negative connotations and is often used as an insult, but it\\'s not slur. It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs, not a type of person. The same is true of the word TERF. It\\'s a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors that deserve to be derogated. The phrase gender critical is really a euphemism, recently created to replace TERF with a phrase that doesn\\'t have such negative connotations. It\\'s perfectly analogous to the phrase race realist, which was invented by racists wanting a more flattering and respectable description of their beliefs. I\\'ve used the term gender critical in this video to be inviting to fence-sitters, but I refuse to cooperate with racists who want me to use their euphemisms and I generally do the same with TERFs. Now I\\'m a very agreeable, non-confrontational person. I usually like to call people by whatever they wanna be called. But when it comes to race realist or gender critical, every time I use these phrases, I\\'m essentially becoming an accomplice in their scheme to legitimize bigotry. And I have especially little patience for TERF requests for linguistic decorum since most of the language used by TERFs is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful, harmful, and insulting to trans people. For instance, TERFs refer to any and all trans-related surgery as mutilation. They call trans women TIMs, an acronym for trans-identified males and trans men TIFs, trans-identified females, obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering. Just to give you a sample of typical TERF prose, here are a couple comments from literally the first thread I saw on the gender critical subreddit while I was working on this video. - [Woman] And I have to admit to considerably more contempt for the likes of (bleeps) since he makes a point of taking selfies with ridiculous, insulting-to-women facial expressions. I also get a good laugh at TIMs putting their hands up to their chins. They\\'re trying to look all dainty and to hide their Adam\\'s apple, but it only draws more attention to their enormous man hands. I saw an AGP photo shoot where this neanderthal in his 50s was posing with one leg up like a flamingo, his hands daintily at his ear. In every photo, even group ones at events. Now I was just grossed out. - So there it is. That\\'s what this is really about. In this video, I\\'ve gone through a list of gender critical concerns and I\\'ve provided responses I hope the average person will find fair. But I would be lying to you by omission if I were to end this video without being real with you about what the core of the gender critical movement is actually about. See what TERFs do in public is they advance what on the surface are a series of feminist critiques of trans people. For example, the critique that hyper-feminine trans women are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes designed to oppress women. At a glance, this appears to be a critique of the way some trans women behave and present themselves. But in the next breath, these same TERFs will argue that trans women are mannish, unfeminine perverts who are forcing masculinity into female spaces. So if trans women being feminine is bad and trans women being masculine is bad, then there really is no way that trans women could behave that TERFs would accept. So in fact, what TERFs really oppose is not trans women being feminine or trans women being masculine, but trans women being trans women. In other words, the fundamental issue underlying all these phony \"concerns\" is transphobia, simple animosity toward trans people\\'s very existence. And it\\'s pretty easy to recognize that just from tone they use when they talk about us. When you read through the gender critical subreddit, or TERF twitter, what you see is just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes draped over a jagged thorn tangle of visceral disgust and targeted hate. The pure exuberant malice of it all is not even disguised in the Germaine Greer quote from the opening of this video or in the average gender critical forum post. \"The enormous, knuckley, hairy, be-ringed paw, \"the pancake make-up through which the stubble \"was already burgeoning,\" \"this Neanderthal in his 50s,\" \"ridiculous, insulting-to-women facial expressions.\" \"Now, I was just grossed out.\" What gender critical feminism really amounts to is a baroque palace of rationalizations built on a foundation of pure disgust. In this respect, it\\'s just like homophobia. You know, I came of age when gay marriage was the most contentious social debate and the arguments people made, that marriage was under attack, that the children would be traumatized, that bestiality would come next, that this tiny minority was undermining all our institutions with their outrageous demands, it was all just nonsense. If you got a conservative drunk, as I used to be able to do, Sylvia, I wish I could give you what I had, he would just blurt out the truth, which was that the sight of two grown men locking lips made him wanna vom. Homophobia and transphobia do not originate in the frontal cortex. They come from the lizard brain disgust response we evolved to deal with blood, infection, vomit, feces, flies, the hairy paw, the stubble burgeoning through the pancake makeup, bleh! It\\'s a disgust I can recognize at a glance because it\\'s the same disgust I felt toward myself for years. It\\'s the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman on the L platform in Chicago five years ago and decided then and there to abandon my first attempt at transition. It\\'s the disgust I still struggle against every day. It\\'s the disgust that\\'s always at the bottom of transphobia because transphobia is always the same. It always comes from the same place and it\\'s always expressed in the same kinds of ways. I recently rewatched that classic viral video from an old episode of Cops where a police officer humiliates a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair. The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID, misgenders her, deadnames her, mocks her clothes and makeup, and calls her a crossdresser. It\\'s all so repetitive and familiar. It\\'s the same arsenal of petty sadism you see in the right-wing press, on 4chan, on doxing forums, on gender-critical Reddit, it\\'s all the same. What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair is her unbreakable wit and confidence in the face of transphobic abuse. The single most iconic moment is when, after being grilled in the back of the cop car amid a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering, she glances back at the cop and says. - Excuse my beauty. - [Officer] Excuse your beauty, okay. - And that, right there, is the single greatest quality of trans-feminine culture, the resilience of trans women, the assumption a regal posture in even the most abject conditions. And that\\'s really all you can do because there\\'s just no reasoning a transphobe out of bigotry. So, to any diehard gender critical feminists still watching this, what else can I say except, on behalf of trans women, excuse my beauty, TERF. (\"Waltz of the Sugar Plum Fairies\") Okay, a tongue pop isn\\'t a solution to every problem. Or is it?

       " 10: ' (film reel whirring) (suspenseful electronic music) - One, Hello Darkness. Hello children, it is I, the darkness within! So, you know how life is like, kinda bad? Well what are you gonna do about that, hmm? I mean there\\'s a few things you can do. First you could work to improve yourself and make the world a better place. That\\'s probably the most effective approach, eventually, but the problem is that it\\'s hard, and I don\\'t like things that are hard. (honky-tonk piano music) Because when you do things that are hard, you have to feel bad now so that you can feel good later. And I don\\'t want to feel good later, I wanna feel good now. And if you want to feel good now, well, you have a couple options. The first is of course to do drugs. And I\\'ve tried that, I spent most of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism, but it turns out that\\'s not a cute look for me, it\\'s not my vibe, so what I do now when I feel the darkness coming is what any respectable woman would do, I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours. Is that a pea under my mattress, your majesty? Or is it another Xanax I left under the throw rug? Now the problem with doing drugs is that when the drugs wear off, you feel bad again. In fact, you probably feel worse. So where do we go from here? Well, how about music? When you feel bad, you want to listen to sad music, because sad music makes you cry, and crying feels good. It\\'s like an orgasm for sad people. And why settle for less than the official meme-song of sadness, \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon and Garfunkel, you know... I\\'m pretty sure there\\'s another Xanax under this throw rug. ♪ Hello darkness my old friend ♪ But in the memes you only hear the first 10 seconds of the song, you only hear \"hello darkness my old friend.\" And that\\'s a very sad first 10 seconds of a song, which is good, because if you\\'re making songs for sad people, it\\'s important to establish your sadness cred up front. Because sad people don\\'t like happy songs. When you\\'re sad, happy songs make you feel like you\\'re being bullshitted. So we\\'re 10 seconds into the song, \"Hello darkness my old friend,\" the key is D# minor, (sad violin music) the saddest of all keys. But when we get to the next line, \"because a vision softly creeping,\" something happens. Let\\'s listen. ♪ Come to talk with you again ♪ ♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪ (gasps) What was that? Suddenly a major chord, an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds, and every peach fuzz hair on the back of my biologically female neck stands on end, hello light! So the song has enticed me with the promise of company for misery, and then it has tricked me into feeling good. And that\\'s what I like about art, it takes the standard disappointments and humiliations of life and cooks them into something worth getting off the floor for. Unfortunately, I don\\'t really play music much anymore because my hands are too beautiful for instruments and my singing voice sounds like a man. So all I really have left is what any aspiring artist with no talent turns to, comedy. And I especially like dark comedy, you know, comedy that\\'s about the things in life that are the most painful. To me, dark humor is kind of like a sad song. It takes your worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties, and twists them into a source of pleasure. And don\\'t all the finest pleasures come from pain? (moans) A lot of the time that means joking about topics that in ordinary life are considered taboo, you know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults. Without the ability to joke and make fun of my own experiences of self-loathing, substance abuse, gender dysphoria, I mean I\\'d probably be on the floor right now looking for that Xanax. But this puts me in a kind of difficult situation, because I want to defend my sense of humor, which I feel is like the core of my personality and what keeps me alive. But at the same time, I\\'ve noticed that a lot of the people in our culture who are really big on defending \"provocative, \"controversial, politically incorrect\" comedy are kind of... dicknuggets? Let\\'s discuss this, and by discuss I mean you sit quietly and I will tell you what to think. Two, Dicknuggets. So the year 2016 had just begun, and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening. Ricky Gervais, an irreverent bad boy atheist comedian, was ranting on Twitter for days and days about how stupid it is that people are offended by things. This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais, a man whose personal branding screams \"I don\\'t care about your feelings, \"I know what it\\'s like to be persecuted for my beliefs, \"I\\'m too much of a badass rebel \"to care what minorities think.\" But in January 2016 Ricky was having an extra badass, irreverent, not-caring-about-your-feelings kind of month. Why? Because he\\'d just hosted the Golden Globes and upset a bunch of people by telling jokes about old tranma Caitlyn Jenner. - But as I say, I\\'m gonna be nice tonight, I\\'ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously. - That\\'s cutting-edge material there, Rick. Very irreverent, very rebellious, very bad boy atheist, ooh. I mean I do wish he wouldn\\'t deadname trans people on stage, but honestly the joke wasn\\'t even as transphobic as a lot of the stuff I\\'ve just come to expect from comics. Still, I\\'m sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it, and Ricky spent the rest of the month tweeting about how offending people is good actually, and how he definitely doesn\\'t care that people were offended. But clearly, Twitter got to him, because two years later he opened his Netflix special with a 13-minute bit rehashing the incident and doing a series of even more... \"irreverent\" jokes. - \\'Cause I\\'ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp, if I say I\\'m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op, but... (audience laughing) Don\\'t ever deadname me. Don\\'t ever call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on you call me Bobo. (sighs) - Does he also identify as an attack helicopter? Does he realize he\\'s doing a meme from 2014 onstage in a $20 million comedy special? My issue with this joke is that, apart from being extremely passe and overdone, it also doesn\\'t make sense unless you ignorantly believe that trans women are delusional men, and even then, it\\'s just not very funny. But am I offended by the joke? Well, I think that it\\'s ignorant, misinformed, unoriginal, and not very funny, and as a great comedian named Ricky Gervais once said, \"to me, an \\'offensive\\' joke is one that\\'s lame, \"badly delivered and not funny enough.\" So by that measure, yes, I\\'d say this \"I identify as a chimp\" bit is pretty offensive. But I\\'m not bringing this old controversy up because I\\'m offended. I\\'m bringing it up because it\\'s just an arbitrary example of a cycle that it seems like our culture repeats about once a week. Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke, and other people are indignant about the fact that those people are offended. The cycle usually gets framed as a battle in a culture war that\\'s supposedly going on between generation snowflake, easily triggered, humorless PC cucks, and badass, edgy, nothing-off-limits free-speech truth tellers. Now if this really is a culture war between two sides, then I am a double agent, because I\\'m a generation snowflake PC cuck who loves dank edgy memes, and I\\'ve found myself on both sides of this type of conflict many, many times. So on the one hand, when I see the internet roasting a comedian for some shitty trans joke, my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn. But my inner edgelady knows how it feels to be dragged across Twitter over a joke. And as someone who basically writes jokes about controversial topics for a living, I appreciate how difficult it is to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy while also keeping your moral compass from getting too jittery. So what I want to try to do is step away from the heat of these social media battles and try to abstract from them some more general philosophical questions. What is the purpose of comedy? What is it that makes comedy good or bad? Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power? Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition? Is it, as Aristotle said, \"the imitation \"of worse-than-average men?\" Or is it just anything anyone laughs at for whatever reason? Well, I don\\'t think there\\'s a single objective answer, I mean, comedy\\'s pretty subjective. But we can probably reach some kind of understanding by discussing this, right? And by we, again I do mean me. The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouths shut. Three, Strawmen. So, as a trans woman up here discussing why I don\\'t think Ricky Gervais\\'s trans jokes are funny, a lot of haters and losers out there are probably gonna try to strawman me. \"Did you just assume the strawperson\\'s gender?\" (groans) Cis people have like two trans jokes and they\\'re both so bad. Here\\'s the strawpersons, assholes. Strawperson one, \"you hate free speech \"and are trying to silence comedians.\" I\\'m not trying to silence anyone. Comedians can say whatever they want onstage, and I can say whatever I want about them. Strawperson two. \"You just can\\'t take the heat when the joke\\'s on you.\" I transitioned on YouTube, making controversial political content all the while, and I read the comments. My heat-taking capacity is among the highest of all time. Of course, I do now have the internalized self-loathing that has damaged my psyche irreparably, but sweetie, who doesn\\'t? Strawperson three. \"You think no one should be allowed \"to joke about trans people.\" I invented joking about trans people. Ever heard of the mouthfeel? I\\'m that tran. That\\'s right, if I die tomorrow, my legacy will be that I applied wine tasting terminology to fellatio, and I accept my destiny. Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people. I live for trans jokes. I just don\\'t think cis people are very good at telling them, because they don\\'t know enough about trans people to know what the funny things are. And being transgender is honestly the perfect topic for comedy. Like, you used to live as one gender, and then you became a different gender. Every single thing about that is absolutely hilarious. But humor is in the details, and Ricky Gervais does not know the details, because he\\'s clearly never been close to a trans person, and that\\'s why he\\'s still telling these tinkertoy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner jokes. And it\\'s too bad, cause I\\'m actually starving over here for good trans comedy, and I mean the real dark stuff too, I\\'m not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline calling her hormones titty skittles. No, I like the edgy stuff, I like being on the edge. Hi, my name is Natalie Wynn, and I enjoy edging. (laughs) Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy that I\\'d like to share with you, because when you\\'re doing art criticism it helps to have positive as well as negative examples, and the exemplary work I have in mind is one that not a lot of people are talking about yet, but which I have no qualms placing in the same company as the works Dante or Swift. I am of course referring to \"My Sperm Bank Experience\" by Gigi Gorgeous. If you don\\'t know who Gigi is, first of all, who even are you, do you have no respect for legends? She\\'s a trans YouTuber, like THE trans YouTuber, whose classic works such as \"MY HEMORRHOIDS\" and \"I HAD SEX WITH A DOG\" long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon. But in this critic\\'s opinion, the crown jewel of Gigi\\'s oeuvre is without a doubt the singular masterpiece \"My Sperm Bank Experience.\" Let\\'s do a close reading. Four, Gigi\\'s Sperm Bank Experience. A great work of literature is never just a text. It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson would call \"a moment within an intertextual dialectic.\" Love that! Let us therefore place \"My Sperm Bank Experience\" within its proper context. Several months earlier, Gigi had released a video about how she and her girlfriend were trying to have a child, so far without success, and so they went to a fertility specialist. Apparently Gigi was not aware that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile, which girl, they tell you like seven times before you start hormones, like how? We\\'ll move past it. A few months later, the notification for \"My Sperm Bank Experience\" shows up on my phone, \\'cause that\\'s right, I clicked the bell, and immediately I knew I was about to experience something special. The thumbnail for this video is so much greater than anything I\\'ve ever conceived of that honestly it makes me feel like a failure, both as a YouTuber and as a woman. The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi\\'s signature, the i\\'s are dotted with hearts. And her facial expression. \"Ew. \"Cum.\" The video begins with Gigi explaining that in order to produce a sample for the clinic, she had to stop taking hormones for three months. - So I hesitantly agreed, I was like fine, I will stop all of my hormones so you know, my shit can get juicy again and I can get a good little sample up in here. - The sperm bank day arrives, she goes to the clinic, and approaches the receptionist. - And I said, \"yes ma\\'am. \"I am here to give sperm from me to be frozen now.\" - The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room, which she describes with the precision of Mama Flaubert. - I walk into this room. Fluorescent lighting the house. I was like, I can see every pore in my arm, like Jesus, what do they want me do here? And then the kicker, this like, leather couch, the back is kind of like angled, so I guess like you can lean and really get into it or something. - The doctor offers her lubrication, pornography if needed, and a donation cup. Gigi closes the door and gets to work. - I get in the mood, I get in the zone, and I\\'m killing it bitch, I am like, I\\'m gonna give the best sample ever, my kid is gonna be a godsent child. Before I know it, the moment has crept up on me and happened, and it\\'s been so long that it hits the wall behind me. - And it\\'s at this moment that glam goddess Gigi Gorgeous gets up off the leather couch and attempts to scrape a prodigious quantity of Gigi jism off the wall of a fluorescent-lit exam room in a desperate final bid to become a mother. - And I took the cup and I was like full-on scraping it off the wall because I was like I\\'m not gonna let any little drop go to waste, you know, I\\'m here, this is like, my moment. - I\\'m trying to understand why this video makes me laugh so much. It\\'s really the contrast of style and substance. Like it wouldn\\'t be funny if a masculine person told this story. It\\'s funny because Gigi has this peak female storytelling style and this Real Housewives diction, but then the story itself is about blasting a giant load onto the wall of a room full of leather and pornography. The dissonance between form and content is genius. And that dissonance perfectly captures the absurdity of being transgender, with a comedic incisiveness that Ricky Gervais could only dream of. I also really relate to this story because right before I started hormones, I decided to freeze a sample of my own, so I too have had a sperm bank experience. And it was exactly like Gigi describes down to every detail. It is not a dignified moment, ladies, there is just no way to feel like a woman while you\\'re hastily rubbing one out in an overlit room designed for men to ejaculate in. I feel so fish right now! (gags) For those five minutes in that exam room, I was a man. Now, I somehow managed to get most of my sample into the cup, but there\\'s a different absurd detail to my story. The receptionist at the sperm bank saw on my paperwork that I was depositing because I was going to start feminizing hormones, and he asked me if there was a name I preferred he call me. In retrospect, he was actually really sweet, and really cute, not that anything was gonna come of that at the time, cause I was pre-everything and rough around the edges. Be honest, I was all edges. But he asked me for my preferred name and I just blurted out Natalie. And so this was actually the first time anyone ever called me by my biological name, and it went like this. The receptionist at the sperm bank turned to me and said, \"right this way, Natalie, here\\'s a cup \"for you to bust a nut in.\" And that\\'s how my life as a woman began. (gags) Now in the end, Gigi\\'s story is actually pretty tragic. Her sample wasn\\'t usable. She wanted to have a child with her own DNA, but she\\'s been on hormones too long and she just can\\'t. And that revelation at the end of the video kind of re-contextualizes how you see the whole story. In this ridiculous image of Gigi scraping ejaculate off the wall, I now see this primal maternal urge to produce and protect children, I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen prematurely from the nest, I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child. - I really really thought that I was gonna have a good sample and I was gonna be able to participate in having a baby with my DNA, but it\\'s just not in the cards for me, and I really wanted to make this video more positive and funny, because there\\'s nothing I can do. - And that\\'s exactly it. That is the darkness. Five, The Darkness. The darkness is my name for what I consider the highest form of comedy, where you take your own worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties, and twist them into a source of pleasure. The darkness is Richard Pryor running down the street in flames because he set himself on fire in a coke-fueled psychosis. The darkness is Gigi Gorgeous scraping her own prodigious jism off the wall of an exam room in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood. If you can make these low points funny, then you\\'re gonna be okay. You\\'re gonna survive. You\\'re gonna make it through life. And I need that now more than ever. Because trans experience is, in a lot of ways, pretty dark. But trans people make it through, because we\\'re good-humored and strong as fuck. Pretty soon I\\'m gonna have to stop hormones before an operation, and I\\'m terrified of that. What\\'s gonna happen to me when I stop hormones, am I gonna become a man again? \\'Cause I don\\'t know if I can handle that. I am thinking about names though. Like maybe Nathan? Or Jayden? I can see myself as a Jayden. See, I\\'ve gotta have my little jokey-jokes or I don\\'t think I could make it through this. Like when I have bottom surgery, I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it as \"my sex-change operation,\" because it makes me laugh, it brings me joy. Calling it \"gender confirmation surgery\" brings me no joy. Now it\\'s important to notice that just because it doesn\\'t make me laugh doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a politically correct euphemism. \"Gender confirmation\" is a more accurate term than \"sex change,\" because you\\'re literally not changing your sex, that\\'s not what surgery does. But edgy people have their own kind of political correctness where they mistake edginess for honesty, accuracy, and directness, and these are very different things. For example, George Carlin has a classic bit about euphemisms that has some great moments, but also some moments that are way off base, for example, content warning, ableist slur. - They say they\\'re going to pre-board those passengers in need of special assistance. Cripples! (audience laughing) Simple, honest, direct language! - So look, I understand the aesthetic preference for simple, honest, direct language, and the repulsion toward verbose, bureaucratic jargon. That\\'s why so much of the rest of this bit is so good. But the word he just used is literally a slur, so I wonder if what you\\'re being honest about is your feelings toward disabled people. Because the phrase \"passengers in need \"of special assistance\" is a little wordy, sure, but in this situation it\\'s actually more accurate since it also includes the elderly, the pregnant, anyone in need of assistance boarding. So I call my gender confirmation surgery \"getting a sex change,\" not because it\\'s more direct and honest, but specifically because it\\'s inaccurate and outdated, and that makes me laugh, not because I\\'m fearless truth-teller, but because I\\'m a bad person. And I get to call it \"my sex-change operation,\" but cis people don\\'t get to call it that, because it\\'s my darkness, not yours. Get your own darkness. When Ricky Gervais jokes about trans people, he\\'s being a hack, because he knows nothing of our darkness. And when someone tries to joke about something that they\\'re totally ignorant of, the result is usually clumsy, awkward, and not very funny. What I\\'d really like to see is if Ricky Gervais took that irreverent bad boy derisiveness and turned it within. Because within is where the darkness lies. Six, Self-Deprecation. Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite, because as a lazy, selfish, preening attention whore who looks like a slightly more passable Ann Coulter with the voice of tropical bird, there\\'s a lot material here to work with. But especially when it comes to these trans jokes, there is a faction of the trans community that is not amused by the buffoonery that goes on on this channel. I think the objection to it is best summed up by the comic Hannah Gadsby, who in her stand-up special Nanette said that when self-deprecation comes from someone who exists in the margins-- - It\\'s not humility, it\\'s humiliation. - And to be honest, I felt a little called out by that. - I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak. - And she\\'s not wrong, like that is how this works. In order to gain an audience as a trans person, you have to demonstrate what cis people call \"self-awareness.\" That is, you have to signal that you see yourself the way the audience sees you, which can mean looking at yourself with a pretty merciless gaze. And of course I\\'m happy to do that because I have no self-respect and laughter is the only way to numb the pain. (laughs) But the terrible thing about being a not-normal with an audience is that don\\'t you don\\'t just get to be yourself, because whether you like it or not, people will see you as a representative of the community. (groans) So because of that responsibility, which I never asked for, I have to balance out the self-deprecation with a lot of positive messaging about my people. And that way, the dark jokes function as a spoonful of sugar to help the feminine penis go down. But even without the group representation issue, it definitely is possible to take self-deprecation too far. As I\\'ve said, I have been diagnosed with an incurable edginess of temperament, and I sometimes do feel suffocated by the safe-space rules of a lot of trans spaces, even though those spaces are there for good reason and a lot of people need them. But sometimes this atmosphere of everything and everyone is valid all the time, no uncomfortable questions may be asked, any self-deprecation is a sign of traumatic internalized bigotry, I just need to get out of there for a while and find a place where I can relax and be my edgy self. I need a safe-space for my edginess, where I can just blurt out whatever stupid question or joke that comes to mind without being afraid that I\\'m going to inflict horrible trauma on everyone around me. So I call up another transsexual edgelady, you know, kiki, accuse each other of being crossdressers, and just laugh it all off. And it\\'s so, so cathartic to do that. But it has to be done in moderation, because can come a point where you\\'re picking at the wound instead of numbing it. And it mostly has to be done in private, because in public, you have to worry about how cis people will interpret it, and so you have to find a way to be self-deprecating without abandoning all social responsibility. (groans) If there was ever phrase that instantly deadens all laughter, it\\'s \"social responsibility.\" But since it\\'s kind of the central topic of the comedy culture war, I should probably say something about it, even though, believe me, I\\'d much rather go back to jabbering about my sex change. Seven, The Eternal Tension. So what is a comedian\\'s job? What is a comedian supposed to do? I suppose my ideal comedian is one who is perfectly able to balance the tension between shitposting and snowflakery. And this is an eternal tension, and must never be resolved. It is a tightrope I have devoted my life to walking. See, if the tension collapses into pure snowflakery, you get a moralist, who might say that a comedian\\'s purpose is to promote justice by punching up, by speaking truth to power, by exposing the flaws of bigoted mindsets and so on. And these are all very admirable goals, but they leave out what I think is the essential purpose of comedy, which is to be funny, to surprise, to shock, to make people laugh. It\\'s kind of like how some art and media critics only ever evaluate a work based on whether or not it\\'s socially progressive, and don\\'t seem to really think about aesthetic pleasure very much, which to me is the reason why art exists in the first place. But then again, I am a hedonistic bourgeois decadent and should probably be sent to the guillotine at once. Just let me do my makeup first so that when they hold my head up, everyone can see my beat and their wigs all fly to the Bastille. Also someone please post the video to my Instagram, \\'cause that\\'s gonna get a lot of engagement. So the opposite of the pure snowflake is the pure shitposter, who might say a comedian\\'s purpose is to make the audience laugh by any means necessary. But that seems kind of barbaric since like, if a guard at a prison camp is torturing an inmate and the other guards are laughing, does that count as comedy? Is a war crime funny? Well, according to the Geneva Convention, it\\'s hilarious. The thing is, I don\\'t think many comedians actually believe in a completely nihilistic vision of comedy. I think they sometimes pretend to when they\\'re trying to evade criticism. I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics and listen to way they talk about their heroes, Lenny Bruce or George Carlin. There\\'s always an element of admiration for bravery, risk, subversion, truth-telling. In other words there\\'s a concern there for what is virtuous and what is true, not just for what makes people laugh. So maybe before we can even talk about what\\'s funny, we have to have a level of shared agreement about what is true and what is morally right. My objection to Ricky Gervais\\'s trans jokes is not just that they\\'re not funny. I think that he\\'s wrong about trans people, and I think his ignorance is infectious. I think he\\'s stirring up bigoted sentiments in his audience, which has the consequence of making the world slightly scarier for people like me. And this is edginess at its worst, just a privileged person with a platform punching down at a politically besieged group he understands nothing about. And that\\'s what happens when the snowflake/shitpost tension collapses into pure shitposting. It\\'s boring and immature. Like when someone says he wants to watch the world burn. You only get to watch when you have the privilege of not being on fire. It\\'s edgy, but it\\'s not the darkness. The darkness is finding a way to laugh about being on fire. Edginess is always adolescent. The darkness is edginess aged by time and pain. And it\\'s only at that full maturity that comedy becomes art, that it becomes comparable to music. So, those are my thoughts, umm, like, comment, and subscribe, uh, the end. Fine, I\\'ll sing the song. (film reel whirring) I wish my brother George was here.

       " 11: ' (suspenseful music) - Hello, my devilish darlings, it is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I\\'m here to warn you that some viewers may find tonight\\'s program disturbing. There will be discussion of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime. Ugh. So if that\\'s gonna make you sad, please don\\'t watch this, unless you enjoy sadness. I know I do. But your macabre mother wants you to take care of yourself. So here, I made you a wet pot of hot tea, and you can take it out on the balcony, and pour it on some pedestrians. That always cheers me up. One. Traps. - Gentlemen of the academy, it is my duty to submit to you the findings of my latest memetic research. Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe scrutinizing volumes ancient and modern in search of the answer to two fundamental questions. What are traps? And be they gay? With respect to the former inquiry, I adduce for your consideration a treatise by the lady scholar known as ThePedanticRomantic wherein the derivation of the word trap is traced to patrons of animated pictures from the orient. Curious. The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century when devotees of picture forums would proclaim the idiom, it\\'s a trap, alongside the likeness of one Admiral Ackbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place. Contemporaneous to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic Japonesques, to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined. The implication being that the subject of the portrait was not in sooth a daughter of Eve, but rather that the spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite skullduggery. Furthermore, it appears that, from the first, the designation trap has signified not only transvestites, but transsexuals as well. And this must needs be remarked, for \\'tis evident such persons ofttimes inflame the lust of ordinary men. It is hence with respect to this phenomenon I pose my second question thus, fellas, is it gay? - I\\'m sorry, who are you talking to? - Gentlemen of the academy! - Did you get thrown of Dairy Queen again? - It must needs be remarked. - Please stop breaking into my house. - I shall be the queen of dairy. - I\\'m sure you will be. Crossdresser. Hi, I\\'m Natalie Wynn, biological woman. Can we pan the camera down? My hair is less high. Are Traps Gay? The meme that will not die. Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male crossdresser or a trans woman, especially in the context of neotenous kawaii decadence. The meme, Are Traps Gay? is a mostly jokey debate about the sexuality of men who are attracted to dickgirls, futanari, MTFs, you know a lot of these men don\\'t know or care about the difference between a trans woman and a crossdresser, so it\\'s kind of pointless to get hung up on that. The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago, after someone released the worst specimens of the White race into the wild. - Are traps are gay? - One of life\\'s most important question. - Are traps are gay. - Traps are gay. Yes. Will there be transsexuals in the ethnostate, hopefully not. - To the men who meme about this topic, it\\'s all lighthearted fun. It\\'s part of a wider game they like to play called, \"Is It Gay?\" You know, is it gay to have an MMF threesome? Only if the balls touch. - Don\\'t cross the streams. - And so on. But to many trans women the meme and the word trap itself are highly offensive. In fact, last year when I first proposed making a video about this topic, many trans people on Twitter were outraged because they felt that this subject is just too harmful to even discuss. So here\\'s the challenge I face with this video, on the one hand there are people who are gonna be upset and offended that I\\'m making a video about this topic at all, and on the other hand there are people who think this is just harmless otaku shitposting and who will be annoyed by all the trigger warnings. But first, to the people who think it\\'s too offensive, here\\'s what I have to say for myself. I have always believed that if you want to persuade anyone, it helps to meet them where there\\'re at. And in this case, \"Are Traps Gay?\" is where people are at. At one of my YouTube meetups I met a high school teacher who told me that he overheard some of his male students joking in the hallway about \"Are Traps Gay?\" When those teenage boys go home and google \"Are Traps Gay?\" who do you want to explain it to them? Your choices are Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy, a Scottish hate crime convict named Count Dankula, or this tran. And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think it should be me. You know, as trans women we have little influence in society. The people who lead the conversations about us are bigger and stronger than we are. So we\\'re like a jogger racing against a car. The only way to win is to hijack the car. And so this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation that straight men are having about us. As always my aspiration is to derive a woke conclusion from edgy premises, to shitpost my way to the moral high ground. Now, straight men, isn\\'t all this offense-taking just more politically correct cuckoldry designed to take away your free speech? Well, I assure you there will be no taking of your free speech on this channel, unless you clock my makeup, dickbag, comment deleted. But if you want to know why trans women are offended by \"Are Traps Gay?\" I\\'m happy to tell you, not to silence you of course, but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity to want to know why someone different from you might be hurt by something that to you seems harmless to you. So, well, let\\'s put it this way. Two. Trans Panic. The 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning depicts the ball culture of black and Latinx gay and transgender people in New York City in the late 1980s. One of the main storylines follows a trans woman named Venus Xtravangaza who describes her precarious existence as a sex worker. - [Venus] I was with a guy and he was playing with my titties till he touched me down there. He felt it and he seen it and he, like, totally flipped out. He said, You fucking faggot! You\\'re a freak! You\\'re a victim of AIDS and you\\'re trying to give me AIDS. What, are you crazy? You\\'re a homo! I should kill you! And, like, I was really terrified, so I just jumped out the window. - During the filming of Paris Is Burning, Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client. Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed. Trans women, in my country almost entirely trans women of color, are murdered at a disgracefully high rate, reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017. The men who murder trans women often claim that they were provoked to violence by the alleged deception of their victims. This is what\\'s called the trans panic defense when legally invoked, as in the 2004 trial of the killers of teenage trans girl Gwen Araujo. One of these killers, who had sex with Gwen before learning she was trans, cried I can\\'t be fucking gay before beating her to death. Men are often willing to side with these killers, saying that if trans women don\\'t want to be murdered then they shouldn\\'t trick men. But what you have to understand is, first, men usually do know when they\\'re sleeping with a trans woman, I mean if you have a dick it\\'s pretty hard to have sex with someone without them noticing it, and second, a lot of men view trans women\\'s entire existence as itself a kind of trickery. A black trans woman named Islan Nettles was murdered in Harlem in 2013 by a man whose friends had mocked him for flirting with her. All she did to \"provoke\" him was walk down the street with two friends. The common thread here is not deception on the part of the victims, but rather the drive of the killers to protect their social standing as masculine and straight. But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure is something that many trans women across class and race experience some version of. Because men view femininity itself as an enticement, as the orchidaceous invitation to a proboscis. I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman who was attacked recently by a man at a bar who started flirting with her until he realized she was trans, and then punched her. Like what was she supposed to do to stop that from happening, just stay at home? For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us for existing actually limit our freedom. There\\'s bars I won\\'t go into because I don\\'t trust the clientele to side with me if some shit like that goes down. And I\\'ve had little scares. I was in the back of an Uber once, and the driver comes on a little flirty, you know, \"What\\'s your name? \"Are you a student?\" And I\\'m thinking Wow, he thinks I\\'m young enough to be a student. But at some point he goes silent and suddenly I\\'m getting a very icy glare in the rear view mirror, like f*cking clocked, and for a second I\\'m like, f*ck I\\'m going to die in the back of this car. And of course I didn\\'t die, the rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine. I\\'m gonna be fine because white middle-class transsexuals don\\'t get murdered in this country. The murder issue exists at a specific intersection of gender, class, and race, and it\\'s really not my oppression to claim. You know sometimes I hear White bougie middle-class computer-programmer trans women be like \"we\\'re being murdered in the streets!\" Who\\'s we? It\\'s not white middle-class trans women. So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane. It exists at this intersection of masculinity and race, and that\\'s just not a conversation that should be lead by a white woman especially when there\\'s so, so, so many things to critique about white masculinity. Let\\'s talk about some now. Three. Taking Offense. Okay, back to traps. Now this is my lane. I\\'m not sure anything has ever been more my lane. Ah the exquisite pleasure of being entitled to the soapbox. So, boys, I\\'ve showed you how trans women\\'s freedom is abridged by our need to navigate around men who view our gender presentation, in fact our very existence as a kind of trap. I think it should therefore be pretty clear why trans women are not the biggest fans of you using that word for us, or for futanari, or crossdressers, or whatever. I mean to be honest if someone calls me a trap my response is more like, wow, a transphobe thought I looked like a woman! But that\\'s because I\\'m so pathetic I have to go dumpster diving for validation. But the rest of the trans women out there, the ones with dignity and self-respect, you should definitely not call them traps. Of course some trans women will overstate the case and say \"the word trap is literally getting trans women killed,\" which, I can\\'t find any cases of the word trap being connected to a murder, but why don\\'t we stop using the word before someone dies, hmm? Because what you\\'re doing when you call trans women traps is you\\'re showing us that you think of us in the exact same way as the men who try to justify attacking us. When a man kills a trans woman literally the argument he trots out in court is that he was trapped. And that\\'s what you\\'re reminding us of when you use that word, that\\'s why trans women are getting triggered over it. You know, sometimes people have good reasons for being triggered by things, and this is one of those times. So, if I were a different kind of creator, I could really end this video now. I think I\\'ve made a pretty convincing case that trans women are justifiably offended by the word trap. But, if I leave it at that, and this is for you Twitter, this is why I\\'m making this video, if I simply argue that \"Are Traps Gay?\" is offensive, then here\\'s what happens. First, a lot of people simply don\\'t give a shit, and in fact my telling them that it\\'s offensive will only make them want to say it more, because they feel on a deep level that they are by nature superior to trans people. So an uppity tr*nny telling them what words they\\'re allowed to say just completely enrages them. So they\\'ll comment, \"traps are gay lel,\" just to reaffirm their superiority over me and that I have no power or influence over them. And there\\'s really nothing I can do about those people. But another group of people, the socially progressive liberals, they\\'ll say, \"Okay, so since you\\'re offended \"by it, I won\\'t say the word trap anymore.\" And they\\'ll be super woke about it, and they\\'ll post Twitter callouts canceling anyone who uses the word \"trap,\" and they\\'ll be very respectful and compassionate towards trans people in public, so long as it makes them look good to indulge and pity this tragic Third World country of a gender minority. But then, they\\'ll go home at night, and in that twilight moment between consciousness and sleep, their inner voice will whisper, \"but are traps gay?\" And then, years later when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend we\\'ll suddenly watch all that shallow wokeness vanish like so much politically correct vapor. Real acceptance has to be built on real understanding. So it\\'s just not enough for me to argue that \"Are Traps Gay?\" is offensive. I also have to argue whether traps are gay. So... are traps gay? Let\\'s watch an instructional video to learn more. (electronic music) Four. The Philosopher. - Hello, boys, it is I, the half-queen, Points. After 30 days and 30 nights the philosopher descended from the mountaintop and to the gathered villagers thus spake, \"Are Traps Gay?\" said he. To whom the half-queen thus replied, \"Hmm, let\\'s see. \"Let me think about it. Oh. (sighs)\" I\\'m gonna stop saying trap now because it\\'s not a good word, as has been explained, in fact it\\'s really best to treat it like a slur. So what we\\'re really asking here is if a man is attracted to or has sex with a trans woman, is that gay? Well the simple answer is no because trans women are women and a man having sex with a woman is, let\\'s see here, according to the experts I\\'ve consulted, it is not in fact gay. But that\\'s not the most persuasive answer because in order to find it convincing you already have to believe that trans women are women. And unfortunately if you ask the average person about this what they say is something like, \"Sure, I think trans women are women, BUT they shouldn\\'t expect that men will want to date them, unless they\\'re into that sort of thing.\" Oh? And what sort of thing is that? Usually when a man tells you he\\'s dating a woman you say, \"Oh what\\'s she like?\" and he says, \"Well, she\\'s from Cincinnati,\" your response is not, \"Oh, David. \"I didn\\'t realize you were into... that sort of thing.\" In other words, these people tell you, \"Trans women are women, BUT...\" and then they say something that shows they don\\'t really think trans women are women at all. So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point, it would basically be circular reasoning for me to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn\\'t gay because trans women are women, since the womanhood of trans women is precisely the point that\\'s being disputed. So maybe the observational approach is better. The facts are indisputable. Many heterosexual men are attracted to trans women and comparatively few gay men are. Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact about our everyday experience in the world. We know who\\'s attracted to us and who isn\\'t. So to us, this completely unnecessary debate is as impractical as the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow. Sure, philosophers can say, \"But how do we know \"the sun will rise tomorrow?\" To which the correct response is, \"Shut the fuck up, nerd, \"stop playing 3D chess against your own brain \"and find a real thing to worry about.\" It\\'s just a basic fact of experience that the sun rises every morning, and for trans women it\\'s a basic fact of experience that the people who are attracted to us, are people who are attracted to women. Of the cis men I\\'ve been with since I started my transition, all identify as straight, and all had only been with cis women before this tran came along. Am I really so powerful a seductress that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay over these tiny tits? Let\\'s not get... cocky. I mean, if a man is attracted to women, and not to men, and he perceives me as a woman and is attracted to me as a woman, and he sleeps with me, and then continues being attracted to women and not to men, in what world is that anything, but a straight man? What wild maze of reasoning do you have to invent to argue that this man is really gay? Well, we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes, beginning with the obvious. What about the penis? Ah yes, the penis. Look, baby, we\\'ll get to the penis, don\\'t you worry about that. But first I should remind everyone that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas because they got. Five, the surgery. In fact, I\\'ve been thinking of signing up for a vagina myself, but the thing is I make too much money for medicaid now, so I have to form an LLC, become my own employee and give myself health benefits, and ugh, it\\'s so much paperwork. You have to become an unincorporated legal entity in this country just to get a f*cking c*nt. Of course, transphobic radical feminists will say that it\\'s not a real vagina, just a f*ckhole, because \"a real vagina is a sacred passage.\" And that\\'s fine by me. What am I gonna do with a sacred passage anyway, get fingered by the pope? Pass! Straight men don\\'t get hung up on this. I guarantee you no man has ever thought of a vagina as a sacred passage. They\\'re either grossed out by it or trying to climb inside. What I\\'m trying to say is, in the past I\\'ve been a little uncertain about getting a vagina because my genital dysphoria isn\\'t that bad, and besides, chicks with dicks are very in right now, very 2019, very trending. And being a dickgirl, it\\'s kind of like being a legendary Pokemon, you know? People take interest, people pay attention to you, and isn\\'t that what we all want? But, unfashionable though it is, I do think I want the surgery because... well, guys can I confess something kind of dark to you? I have this really fucked up fetish where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina. Crazy, right? I mean I like anal, but you know the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well, ew. I don\\'t want to eat well. I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get dicked, is that a crime? It is kind of a scary surgery though, like what if my vagina sucks? - I\\'m afraid I have some bad news. The tests are back and are showing that, in the medical terminology, your vagina does indeed suck. The point is, the easy-sell version of the argument I\\'m making is that there is nothing homosexual about a man\\'s attraction to a trans woman who\\'s been on hormones for a couple years. She has female skin, she smells like a woman, she has breasts, she\\'s giving hair body face, she\\'s post-op and has a vagina. Now even in this situation people will say it\\'s gay because of the chromosomes. But look, human beings have five senses and none of them can detect chromosomes. Sexual attraction is not based on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender. It\\'s based on perception, and if you\\'re a man, and you perceive someone as a woman, and you\\'re attracted to her as a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment, my dude. Congratulations, you\\'re a breeder. Now the argument people make is, \"Okay fine, it\\'s straight if you mistake her for a biological woman, but if you know she\\'s a man and you\\'re still attracted then it\\'s gaaaaay. So look, if you believe that trans women are men, then that belief might interfere with your perceptions, and it might change the relationship between your perceptions and your sexual response. But more likely is that you still will feel attraction to the trans woman, only, if you value your identity as a straight man, you\\'ll feel ashamed of your attraction, and you\\'ll try to fight it and deny it, and you\\'ll probably end up treating trans women like absolute garbage. Now, if I wanted to make the SJW 101-type response here, I would say that trans women are women because they identify as women, and so every heterosexual man who\\'s experienced attraction to a trans woman is necessarily experiencing heterosexual attraction, because of the way the person he\\'s attracted to identifies. But that\\'s just replacing the black-and-white thinking of the biology dogma with the black-and-white thinking of an identity dogma. But human sexuality is not black and white. It\\'s not even shades of gray. It\\'s like a multicolor acid trip, it\\'s centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle. So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes, but it\\'s usually not based on psychological identity either. Most of the time initial attraction anyway is based on what I\\'d call presentation, how you look and act. And I think that\\'s especially true of men, they get turned on by that initial visual pop, they see, they conquer, they come. I mean, you have to admire the simplicity of it. (sad violin music) Sometimes I wish I were a man. So look, if what you want is a woman who pops, then rest assured there are plenty of trans women who pop. Maybe you don\\'t think I pop, but you\\'d be hard-pressed to argue that any number of trans models and actresses don\\'t pop as much as any cis woman pops. So the pop is undeniable, no one\\'s questioning the pop. In fact, without the pop, it would never have occurred to men to call trans women traps because they wouldn\\'t be \"trapped\" if they weren\\'t attracted in the first place. But a lot of men seem to think that the pop, the visual presentation of a trans women, is some kind of illusion or facade, that at some point will be dropped, revealing that our womanhood is a sham and that we\\'re really men. No. Here\\'s a big difference between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen. If you date a cis drag queen, at some point you\\'re getting a man, honey, as explained by the only good YouTuber, Jasmine Masters. - I don\\'t want to date nobody that want to date me like this because this comes off and you not doing nothing with this. - But if you date me there\\'s no de-dragging, there\\'s never a moment where I become a man. Baby, what you see is what you got. At least on this side, this is my natural side. And this side is my biological side. - [Ben] We\\'re discussing people who are trans we immediately scan the first paragraph of \"trans woman\" and then refer to them by their biological pronoun because biology is (music drowns out speaker). - Everyone\\'s always hating on trans women for being stereotypically feminine. So why do you think that in the bedroom we\\'d be any other way? Part of it is that people are really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy and what that does for trans women. It feminizes our skin, our smell, our body fat distribution, it makes us grow breasts. That\\'s right, these are my very real, very biological titties. I mean I\\'m wearing a push-up bra, but at least there\\'s something to push up now. Here, I\\'ll show you. I mean they\\'re small, but it\\'s not by any measure a male chest, and what I have is very real, very biological, and very female. You people think everything to do with trans women is fake. Fake voice, fake boobs, fake hair. But that\\'s prejudice more than observation, like I\\'ve noticed that whether or not I actually wear a wig in a video has exactly zero effect on how many people comment to call me a man in a wig. So I may as well just wear wigs. And I may as well get my boobs done too since people are gonna call them fake either way. But for what it\\'s worth this is my real hair, at least this half, and these are my real boobs, and if I bring a home a gentleman, (whispers) or a lady, all that stays on in bed, and it\\'s there when I wake up in the morning. But what about the penis? All right, all right. Look, if the penis is feminine, how is that gay? I rest my case, roll credits. ♪ You can make me you ♪ - Six. The Feminine Penis. Look, some guys want the Ts and the D. And that\\'s the T. Now a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick, even a ladydick, makes any sexual interaction with a man gay. But isn\\'t male homosexuality usually understood as the attraction to men and not merely to penises wherever they may arise. I think there are probably some gay men who really just like dick, and I\\'m not judging, I\\'m not here to attack anyone\\'s preferences. But being a straight man, I don\\'t really think that\\'s best understood as a man attracted to vaginas. You call women \"pussy,\" but then you\\'re always like, \"Ew periods, I\\'m a straight man, I\\'m not used to putting a towel down when I f*ck, I don\\'t know how to use a condom because I just expect cis women to be on birth control and do everything for me.\" And you have straight incels online calling labia roast beef and generally putting on a show of vaginal disgust, I mean if you\\'re gonna date cis women or post-op trans women I think you really owe it to them to be a little more vagina-positive. \\'Cause at the same time, even though straight men are like, \"ew dicks, that\\'s gay,\" you guys also kinda love dicks? You\\'re always drawing them, your buildings look like dicks, your porn all has dicks in it. So what about dicks on chicks? Well men like chicks and men like dicks, so what\\'s the problem, officer? I think the booming popularity of t-girl porn speaks for itself. On Pornhub the Shemale category contains more videos than other such popular categories as rough sex, orgy, and webcam. And it\\'s mostly straight men who watch it. When adultempire.com moved their t-girl content from their gay site to their straight site, views increased 50%. In the 2016, the same year North Carolina passed a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom bill, the adult site GameLink\\'s top selling titles in North Carolina were \"My Transsexual Teacher,\" \"Shemale Shenanigans,\" and Joey Silvera\\'s \"Trans-Visions 6.\" A lot of straight men first find out about trans women through porn, which is not great since most t-girl porn is not trans-positive, and uses dehumanizing slurs like \"shemale\" and \"tranny.\" Which is how you end up living in a country full of people who will jerk off to you, but won\\'t give you rights. So to a lot of men that\\'s the representation we have, shemales, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner. Great! I love that for us. Now there probably are some men who will always be put off by a woman\\'s having a dick, and you know what? That\\'s fine. Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage. You like what you like. I\\'m not here to police anyone\\'s desires. In fact quite the opposite, I\\'m here to liberate men of sophisticated taste from society\\'s cruel and unjust prejudice against their t-girl-loving ways. But liberation begins with understanding so who are the men who love trans girls? Well, according to the trans women I\\'ve talked to and my own personal experience, the men who date us can be divided into three general groups. Group one are men who, to be honest, are actually kind of put off by the dick, but they\\'re so attracted to the woman it\\'s attached to that they\\'re willing to work around it, or wait for it to... grow on them. Group two are men who are attracted to trans women including their penises, but they don\\'t specifically fetishize the penis either, and wouldn\\'t mind if their trans lover had genital reassignment and got a vagina. And then group three are men who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks, and often want to worship the penis or be penetrated by it. Now group three are what the trans community calls \"chasers.\" Dating chasers is generally a bad idea because their attraction to us is based around fetishizing our genitals, which is often the part of us that we are most uncomfortable with. So if you\\'re a t-girl who likes men, then group two is really Goldilocks perfection unless you really like topping or you\\'ve had \"the surgery.\" Now I should say that group two does include some bisexual men. And bisexual people of either gender can be great partners if you\\'re trans. You like girls, you like dick, I\\'m a girl with a dick, let\\'s make this happen. That said, if someone views that part of me as male, and wants me to do with it what men do with it, then pass, not interested. Now you might be wondering, \"What is this postmodern neo-Marxist SJW insanity? How could I view it as anything other than a male part? It\\'s a f*cking penis.\" Well, I\\'m glad you asked. I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone about the ecstasies of the feminine penis. You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine, context, usage, and physiology. So first, context. Picture in your mind\\'s eye a feminine woman. Now picture her with a penis. That\\'s not a man\\'s penis, that\\'s a woman\\'s penis. It\\'s feminine because of the context that it\\'s in. Second, usage, a lesson in penis etiquette: A gentleman need not be coy about his penis. He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug, he may penetrate, he may order you to get on your knees like a good girl and (bleeps). Whereas, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a lady of good breeding never brandishes her penis. When she rises from the bath she covers it gracefully with a demure hand, and when not in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away. Here\\'s how to tuck your penis like a lady. The first step is to put on a set of vicious stilletto claws. This doesn\\'t make things any easier, but it does build character. Next, you want to take not one, but two pairs of cotton-lined poly/spandex bikini-cut panties, at least one size too small, and pull them most of the way up your legs. Now, there\\'s no way to put this delicately, my dears. You\\'re gonna take your claws and you\\'re going to grab your scrotum, and you\\'re gonna yank that bubblegum back into your peach crease. Now hold it in place with one hand and with your other hand you push your penis back, pressing those little eggs up into your pelvis. Bring your thighs together to hold all that in place, and pull your panties up. Front first, then back, run your hand over it to make sure nothing\\'s seeping out the sides and then voila, it\\'s like it was never there. For more information, you can purchase my book, Tuck Your Penis, with a new forward by Dr Jordan B Peterson. I\\'ve now explained both the context and the usage of the feminine penis, so let us now turn to the physiology. Most people don\\'t realize that taking feminizing hormones actually changes the anatomy and functionality of the genitals, shrinking everything down, and softening everything up. That means changes to a little thing not a lot of people are talking about, but something I\\'ve been trying to raise awareness of, you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue, really get people talking about Seven, The Mouthfeel. - Oh hi, it\\'s me, Natalie Wynn, your tasting specialist. I have tasted everything, the royal flush of oral sex. Girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy, and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris. But today, we amuse the palette with the feminine penis. Now with respect to flavor, the feminine penis has more sweetness than the masculine penis, and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick umami. With with respect to mouthfeel, the feminine penis is, of course, softer and smoother than the masculine penis, and does not become as turgid. And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes of saline, while boy come is milky, viscous, and more acidic. It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers, that sucking a female penis is not gay. Cheers. (suspenseful music) - Eight. Being Straight Is Pretty Gay. So I\\'ve been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women. But ultimately you kind of have to try it yourself to fully understand viscerally understand why sex with a trans woman is sex with a woman. Now we must always be wary of being over-simplistic in our thinking. Sexuality is complicated, and while it is undeniable that many straight men are attracted to trans women, the messy reality is that a lot of straight men who are attracted to male crossdressers. Before I transitioned I was a crossdresser, and I didn\\'t present super womanly either, like fully Dr Frank-N-Furter. And that\\'s why I\\'m so iconic. I showed the world that in two years you can transition from literally Dr Frank-N-Furter to a very real, very biological drag queen. But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite I still got semi-regular messages from men being like, \"So I\\'m a straight man, but I\\'m like really attracted to you \"when you dress like a woman and it\\'s really \"making me question my sexuality.\" Now I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like, \"Well maybe those men just picked up on my inherently womanly female energy essence that I\\'ve always had since I was born a female biological soul trapped in the body of a crossdressing baby.\" But let\\'s be real. There are straight men who f*ck crossdressers, there are straight men who f*ck drag queens, there are straight-identifying men who f*ck other straight-identifying men. What is going on here? Straight men, what is your deal? Who are you? What is your life? How did you become straight? Did they recruit you? Were you groomed? I blame the parents. Let\\'s go back to that game that you guys like to play, the game I call, \"Is This Gay?\" The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that they\\'re sex acts between people of the same gender. But I\\'ve heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that\\'s gay, or that it\\'s gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples. To be clear we\\'re talking about one man and one woman, Eve sucking Adam\\'s nipples, and according to these men it\\'s totally gay. What that shows us is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a man and a woman. It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who are playing the correct roles. So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according this very fragile view of heterosexuality, he ceases to be straight. Even a man\\'s relationship with his own body is policed by these narrow confines. For instance, some men won\\'t even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos. I mean, to be fair before I washed my asshole I was a quarterback. Now I\\'m a cheerleader! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y don\\'t tell the coach I was a guy! This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation. Basically, it\\'s a style of moral thinking, that treats the body like a temple that must be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can f*ck and what you can eat, so for example religious dietary laws. I think this hypermasculine hetero man code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of kosher law governing straightness, and the \"Is This Gay?\" game is its theology. Now this whole line of thinking has been reduced to absurdity pretty effectively by, of all people, Count Dankula. - If you class yourself as a straight man and you\\'re masturbating, that means that you\\'re touching a dick, and that\\'s gay. - Well meme\\'d my lord, well meme\\'d. - The pinnacle of the whole discussion is reached when Dankula concludes that since a woman inherits half her DNA from her father, she is technically half a man, and therefore having sex with a woman is pretty gay. Obviously this is shitposting, but it\\'s logically just as good an argument as \"traps are gay because chromosomes.\" So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay. So what is being gay? Socrates. Uh, on second thought I don\\'t know her. Nine, Being Gay Is Good Actually. Sometimes when you\\'ve been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it\\'s good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the first place? Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight? It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with manhood, and they defend their manhood at all costs. Now men, this might to be difficult to hear, and maybe you don\\'t want to hear it from me, but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it\\'s hurting cis women, it\\'s hurting trans women, and it\\'s hurting gay people. For one thing, it makes you really, really bad at sex. Who wants to sleep with a guy who\\'s so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can\\'t even enjoy his own body? Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay. Being pegged does not make you gay. Sucking another man\\'s dick just to try it, does not make you gay. And why? Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is persistently attracted to people of the same gender. If you\\'re persistently attracted to people of the same gender, and you identify with the word gay, then you\\'re gay. If not, then you\\'re not, and nothing you can do will change that. So that\\'s one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is good actually. I mean, why would you be worried about this if you didn\\'t think being gay was bad? Now, I don\\'t identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense - we, the gays! - but as a queer person I can\\'t help but be a little wounded by the fact that straight men are so obsessed with proving that they aren\\'t like us. But that is not a wound I am going to dwell on, because life is much too short for me to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage. Are traps gay? Baby, who cares. Just do what feels good. That\\'s the simple answer. But the truth is that when people say traps are gay, but there\\'s nothing wrong with being gay that\\'s nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men, and to reinforce the stigma against dating us among the group of people who are, in fact, most attracted to us. Because it\\'s mostly straight men, and not gay men, who like us. And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted to us are willing to openly date us. And the stigma is very real. A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness. Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they experience in short, a sample of the difficultly all queer people face. But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people\\'s prejudices control his life. A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him. A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves. And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I\\'m still more of a man than you. 10. I Have Feelings Too. - Well I guess today we learned that \"Are Traps Gay?\" is not a debate worth winning, because just by participating, we\\'re accepting the validity of an insincere question and the bigoted assumptions it relies on. Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is deserved. #NotAllGamers. But also this video completely centers men\\'s feelings, and I have feelings too goddamn it, and some of those feelings aren\\'t all that different from the anxieties men have. Lemme explain. Lemme explain. So, I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology for confused slutbag. Before I transitioned, I dated women, and I still do have lesbicious and lesbaniacal feelings, but early in my transition I encountered a lot of TERF shit and it really scared me off dating cis lesbians, which I never have. Even before I transitioned the question, \"do I want to fuck men?\" had been in the back of my head for a long time, and then a year ago I was like I want to fuck men. I want to fuck men. But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified. Because men are scary, and in my early transition, I\\'d only dated bisexual trans people and enbies, and just as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory. A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed. That teaches you something about gender that might be hard to learn otherwise. And loving a trans woman, like I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I\\'m a real woman, but to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as like, the radiant model of womanhood that\\'s an experience that\\'s meant a lot to me and if you\\'re attracted to women and that\\'s an experience you haven\\'t had, you\\'re missing out. But what I was gonna say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a safe group of people to date when you\\'re early in transition because they\\'re pretty chill about anatomy and presentation. But if you\\'re gonna date cishet men, you need to be serving woman and, I mean, I guess you don\\'t need to be, but it doesn\\'t hurt, and I did wonder if I was woman enough for it. So the first couple times I was so afraid, I was like when I take my clothes off is he gonna think I\\'m a man, I mean basically my anxiety was are traps gay? But what I ended up doing is just working up to things gradually. And of course, you start by sucking dick. That\\'s very safe because like, what red-blooded man is gonna turn down a tgirl blowjob? And it doesn\\'t involve my junk in any way. Then I got a little bolder and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned we\\'d been guy friends, so to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between a man and woman, like, that shit is super hot. Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk and I let a straight guy go down on me, which I was so nervous about because like, what if he thinks I\\'m a man, what if he\\'s repulsed? Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked? The answer is yes. It was so hot. I loved it, he loved it, and just knowing that he\\'d never done that before, but I was just so special, 10 out of 10. And you know what he told me after? He told me he liked the mouthfeel. Everyone\\'s talking about it now, bitches. So look I really don\\'t want to shame men for feeling anxious about dating trans women because I mean, I was anxious too in the other direction. But I do want to shame men for treating trans women like their dirty little secrets. And I do wanna shame men for dehumanizing us and voting away our rights by day, while jerking off to shemale porn by night. And I do wanna shame men for refusing to date us because they\\'re not f*cking strong enough to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every moment of every day. I do wanna shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends because they couldn\\'t stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes. That is pathetic. If you\\'re so worried about proving you\\'re a man, why don\\'t you start by standing up for the women you love, you chickenshit cowards. So look, what I\\'m asking for is so basic. Don\\'t call human beings traps. If you\\'re attracted to trans women, don\\'t be ashamed of it. It\\'s okay, you can date us, we\\'re more than just jack-off material. If you aren\\'t attracted to trans women, respect the people who are. If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess because God knows she\\'s been through enough shit. And finally, protect trans women of color at all costs. All I want here is basic human decency, is that really too much to ask? Well, this is the Internet, so yes. Yes it is. Goddamn it. - Well, that was long. I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful woman\\'s penis.

       " 12: ' (calm mysterious music) - Bring me another bottle of Moët, would you, Antoine? Apparently the world is ending. Well, where is he? Sometimes I\\'m so goddamn beautiful it makes me want to throw up! Ugh, I\\'ll get it myself. (calm dramatic piano music) (bath swishing) (knocking) Antoine? - There you are. - Ugh, it\\'s this nerd again. Hey Doc, can you bring me my smelling salts please? - I\\'ll think about it. Have you watched my video yet? - (sighs) The one about the apocalypse? - No, Marie, it\\'s not about the apocalypse, it\\'s about how to stop climate change. - You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice. Well, I can\\'t stand that. - Well, why don\\'t you watch a few minutes and then I\\'ll bring you your smelling salts? - This is extortion. You\\'re sinking to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat. My God. You cucks will stop at nothing. - That\\'s right, open wide. - No. No. No! - Welcome to the lab, the lab of aesthetic climatology. Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now? Imagine that this is the earth. This is what the earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife. In 1976, a beta cuck named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming. For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness about the grave predictions of climate science, in particular, the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Gore\\'s activism culminated in 2006, with the release of his documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\", but a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park ridiculing Gore as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation about a mythological creature called ManBearPig. - It is half man, half bear, and half pig. - The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic, attention-seeking alarmist, an issue-haver, a care-about, a sibilant moralf(bleep)g. I\\'m super cereal, you guys. (audience laughing hysterically) We all had a good laugh at Gore\\'s foolishness. After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news, and in fact a lot of us probably remember ManBearPig better than we remember \"An Inconvenient Truth\". A lot of this backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay \"Why Are You So Angry?\" by Innuendo Studios. Part 2 of the essay describes a phenomenon I\\'ll call the Angry Jack effect. It works like this: You\\'re at a barbecue shoving brisket into your front hole when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they\\'re vegan. Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan, because even if they\\'re not really judging you, the mere fact that they are vegan means that they probably have reasons for not eating meat, and that means there might be reasons why you shouldn\\'t eat meat. So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell you them, \"Oh, so you think you\\'re better than me, huh? \"Well, I\\'ll have you know that eating meat \"is perfectly natural, and evolution, \"and people who don\\'t eat meat, well, their bones fall out, \"and besides, you\\'re a hypocrite anyway \"because more animals die when they plow the fields \"for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.\" Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation. This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt, from the potential accusation that you\\'re a bad person, and you\\'re protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat. And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades. He\\'s a fun-ruiner, criticizing our high-emission way of life, and instead of engaging sincerely with the critique, we lash out at him so we don\\'t have to think about it. The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real, and Gore was right all along. Oopsy doopsy! (descending horn music) So now it\\'s current year, and the global temperature has risen one degree Celsius above the pre-industrial average, which is on track with the projections presented in Gore\\'s film. Now one degree doesn\\'t sound like much, but to get a sense of scale, consider that the last ice age was only 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler than the 20th century norm. We are already at one degree warmer than the pre-industrial average, and current scientific models put us on track for three degrees warmer by the end of the century, an outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami. Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to two degrees in order to avert global cataclysm. But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that even two degrees of warming could result in an iceless arctic summer at least once a decade, the destruction of nearly every coral reef, and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world. The report therefore recommends we limit warming to 1.5 degrees, a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years and net zero emissions by 2050. But even limiting warming to two degrees requires a significant reduction in emissions. Otherwise we\\'re on track for three degrees of warming and possibly even four or more, a situation that could be near apocalyptic-- - (exhales) Look, Doc. This is just the same liberal media bullshit we\\'ve all heard for decades. Weather changes sometimes. You were just talking about the ice age. First it was cold, now it\\'s getting warmer. That\\'s just nature. - Do you honestly think that all the world\\'s leading climate scientists just forgot to take into account that the weather changes sometimes? - Isn\\'t it obvious to you that this whole guilt-trip about carbon emissions is just an attack on the American way of life, another excuse for big government to take away my freedom? - What freedom? Are you an oil company? - Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company? Isn\\'t that what you liberals think? My identity is valid. - No, it isn\\'t. - Bring me my smelling salts. - Watch the goddamn video. (key clicks) Imagine the year is 2100. I want you to picture the earth as a human vagina and imagine you\\'re a gynecologist and you\\'re using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon. How does that make you feel, kids? I bet you wish your irresponsible gas-guzzling parents had done something to stop this. So we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching, but at least our political leaders are responsible, rational, and scientifically literate, right? - Is there climate change? Yeah. Will it go back like this? I mean, will it change back? Probably, that\\'s what I think. I believe it goes this way. - Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial, from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax aimed at undermining American manufacturing to his tweet last week that it\\'s very cold outside, therefore, \"Whatever happened to Global Warming?\" Of course the term global warming refers to the increase in the global average temperature, temperature continuing to vary by region. In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder, for instance, if the ocean current known as the Atlantic conveyor belt is disrupted, chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe. But Trump doesn\\'t know or care about any of that. He\\'s kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know? A real man who takes what he wants by any means necessary and won\\'t be slowed down by any worries about what\\'s factual or scientific or true or good or consensual or just or safe or legal or even possible. He\\'s the kind of man who Americans collectively want, on some sub-rational erotic level, to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god-emperor. Burn the scholars, build the wall. But the problem, at least for those of you who don\\'t actively enjoy civilization\\'s plunge into primeval darkness, is that the notion that there\\'s any actual scientific controversy about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false. A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change found that 97% of papers published on the subject supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming, and the consensus has only increased over time. Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe, but is very common in America, largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation that goes back to the early 1990s, when the Western Fuels Association developed a strategy to quote, \"reposition global warming as theory, not fact,\" and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way to promote that message via a propaganda campaign. Climate denialist talking points promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family, and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians, perhaps most vocally Senator James Inhofe, whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies, and who\\'s presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments as throwing a snowball to own the libs. - So here, Mr. President, catch this. (sniffs) Mm-hmm. - Denialist talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins, where they provide ammunition for the Angry Jack effect. Just like Al Gore or any messenger of inconvenient information, climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment. Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph, has received thousands of hate messages, death threats, even white powder in the mail. The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation, and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future. It\\'s likely that this video will attract some deniers, and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as: \"There\\'s still scientific controversy \"about the cause of climate change.\" There isn\\'t. \"What if the sun is getting hotter?\" It\\'s not, at least in the relevant time frame. And, \"science is a liar sometimes.\" (gong rings) - Oh boy. - But even if you don\\'t believe in science, maybe you\\'ll find it convincing that even many oil companies, including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real and caused by human activity. In fact, at the behest of oil companies, the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast, largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides and more severe tropical storms. After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion to quote, \"future-proof the state,\" despite the fact that many of its top politicians are public climate change deniers. - You remember how it used to be called global warming? And then magically the theory changed to climate change? - Sure. - The reason is, it wasn\\'t warming. - Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids. The science is clear: Climate change is real and humans are causing it. If even ExxonMobil says it\\'s real, it\\'s probably real. There\\'s really no point in digging in your heels and refusing to look at the evidence just because you don\\'t want it to be true. None of us want it to be true-- - Okay, fine. So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer. And maybe humans have something to do with it. Now can you give me my smelling salts? - (sighs) Fine. - Look, Doc, I gotta say, maybe the scientists are right, maybe it is happening. But to be honest with you, I\\'m having a hard time caring about this, like, at all. - How can you not care about this? We\\'re talking about the future of the planet. - Well, I don\\'t care about the planet. I care about me. - Well, don\\'t you live on the planet? - Mm-hmm. - And don\\'t you care about what happens to the planet you live on? - No. - Goddamn it. Watch the video. (key clicks) If you picture the earth as a watermelon, you can see there\\'s the outer shell here that traps the Red Flesh. And if you leave it out at midnight, the stalkers, the stalkers come for the Red Flesh. Before describing the details of our doom, let\\'s take a moment to review how we got where we are. The modern science of anthropogenic climate change began in 1896 when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arrhenius published a study titled, \"On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air \"Upon the Temperature of the Earth,\" in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production would eventually have a warming effect on the planet. By 1960, scientists had demonstrated that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was in fact rising, and President fuckin\\' Johnson\\'s Science Advisory Committee warned that industrial CO2 emissions could have a greenhouse warming effect. The Stanford Research Institute warned the American Petroleum Institute in 1968 that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting and rising sea levels, but nothing was really done about it until 1988, when NASA announced to the U.S. Senate that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history, that the warming could be attributed to human causes with 99% certainty, and that the warming was worsening heatwaves, storms, and droughts. That same year, the IPCC was formed to provide world leaders with a summary of the science on climate change and its political and economic impacts. So it started to seem like something was going to change. But by the early 1990s, the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry was up and running in the United States, despite the fact that oil companies had known climate change was happening for decades, and Republican politicians became mouthpieces for the so-called \"skeptic\" cause. Meanwhile the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol, pledging the United Sates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on. The 2012 Republican platform stated against all scientific consensus that quote, \"the causes and long-range effects \"of a phenomenon are uncertain,\" and opposed regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions. Then finally, in 2015, things seemed to be changing for the better. 195 nations, including China, India, and the United States under Obama became parties to the Paris Agreement, which established the goal of limiting the increase in global temperature to well below two degrees Celsius. But the very next year, Donald Trump was elected president of the United States on a platform of outright climate science denial. Trump has since begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, appointed a climate change denier the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and released his America First Energy Plan, which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels. So it\\'s with a particular sense of doom that we now receive the grim 2018 IPCC report, which informs us that the world has already warmed one degree Celsius, resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps, increased average temperatures, increased extreme weather events, and increased mosquito-born illnesses like malaria, dengue, and Zika. If drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030 and to net zero carbon by 2050, global warming will still increase to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average, resulting in a doubling of populations exposed to water scarcity and drought, and an estimated $10 trillion in annual flood damage losses from sea level rise. But with the current political situation, the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees is quickly slipping out of reach. By the end of the century, we\\'re likely to see at least two degrees of warming, which will lead to the eventual displacement of 200 million people in coastal regions. Three degrees of warming will flood many of the world\\'s major coastal cities, including Shanghai, Miami, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Alexandria, and Hong Kong. Four degrees of warming will be close to the difference between early 20th century temperatures and the last ice age. A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees from island and coastal areas will be exacerbated by severe droughts and water scarcity, trillions of dollars of damage to the economy, famines, starvation, terrorism and war. So it\\'s not just the poor polar bears and coral reefs. There are real human consequences to this. (key clicks) See, this is why you should care. It\\'s not just about the planet. It\\'s about the millions of people who are gonna die or lose their homes. - Oh, jeez, wow, that\\'s, (sighs) gosh, that\\'s really just too bad. - What kind of response is that? - Look, Doc. People die all the time. What I am supposed to do, cry about it? - No, you\\'re supposed to take political action. - Yeah, I guess I could do that, but this bath is very relaxing. - (sighs) Well, look, even if you only care about yourself, you do realize that when the coastal cities flood, we\\'re gonna have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right? Are you gonna be okay with that? - No! - Well, then you\\'d better do something to reduce carbon emissions. - No! - Well, then you\\'d better be ready to take in a lot of refugees. - No! - You do realize, right, that in a hundred years everyone is going to look back on people like you and they\\'re gonna hate you so much for what you allowed to happen to this planet. - (sighs) Well, those are future people. I\\'m alive now. And besides, if what you\\'re saying is true, then this is basically the apocalypse anyway, so why not just party and enjoy ourselves, right? - But it\\'s not the apocalypse though. Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form of denialism. Because we still have a little bit of time to fix the problem. Please, (scoffs) God, please just try to focus on solving the problem while we still have time. - So, you\\'re saying the world is ending. Cheers to that. - (sighs) The world is not ending. It\\'s just getting shittier. - Well, what am I supposed to do about it? - Let\\'s watch an instructional video to learn more. - (sighs) All right. Let me just re-up here. (sniffs deeply) - Ugh. - All right, Doc. Put it in me. - You are repulsive. - Well, I\\'m so sorry you\\'re offended by pleasure! - I\\'m not offended by, what? - This offends you, doesn\\'t it? Are you triggered, liberal? Are you triggered? - No, I\\'m, (scoffs) I\\'m not, I\\'m not triggered. - Stop trying to pretend you\\'re not owned. - You know, you really shouldn\\'t be supporting the dairy industry. They cause massive carbon emissions. - Well, maybe you shouldn\\'t be supporting the clothes industry, hypocrite. - What? - It\\'s soymilk anyway, science nerd. How do you think I got so feminine? - There\\'s nothing in science to support that. - Just admit that you\\'re offended. - Please just watch the video. (key clicks) (uncanny music) (chewing) When I was a little girl, I used to sit on the porch eating watermelon and I\\'d stare up at the stars and wonder where did they all come from, you know? What does this all mean? The cosmos, humanity, our little time here on Earth? And that\\'s why I became a scientist, so I could spend my life studying ...tropospheric trace gases. (depressed violin music) If you want to do your part to stop climate change, there are some lifestyle changes you can make. You can use LED light bulbs. You can drive a hybrid or electric car. You can use public transportation. You can try not to fly very often. You can eat less red meat. But the reality is just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions, and the burden of stopping this can\\'t really be placed on individual consumers. The companies themselves do not care. Left to their own devices, they will only pursue short-term profit. They will ask the government to build them sea walls while continuing to emit greenhouse gasses. Climate change is exactly the kind of problem that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve. The time frame involved is short enough that scientists can predict total catastrophe in the foreseeable future, but just long enough not to enter into the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations. So unless there\\'s a drastic change in the next couple decades, this is going to be capitalism\\'s Great Chinese Famine moment, only potentially, it\\'ll be much, much worse. This is probably the most important issue facing humanity in the 21st century, so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary, beginning with rapid political change. If that means direct action, it means direct action, for instance organizing, participating in, or supporting a massive general strike. You also should demand that your politicians take a strong stance against climate change and the companies that cause it. And if you\\'re American, vote this monumental dingdong out of the Oval Office in 2020 before the entire planet shrinks and transforms into a corn cob. (long beeping) - So let me get this straight. You want me to go vegan, drive a Prius, and vote Democrat. You\\'re basically asking me to completely change who I am as a person and become everything I hate. - Yeah, pretty much. But it\\'s not about what I want. It\\'s about what everyone has to do to preserve the survival of humanity. - Well, (sighs) electric cars, veganism, who can even afford that shit? - Maybe you could afford it if you drank less champagne. (bottle clatters) - I shall do no such thing. - Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco. - I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater. - You know, eating plant-based meals actually costs less than eating meat. - Oh okay, so just never again enjoy the morning aroma of bacon sizzling on the skillet, barbecued ribs, fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops, bloody steaks. Mmm. - Ew. Why do you want to eat all that murdered animal flesh anyway when you could eat pure, clean and natural foods, like lentils, barley, and sprouts? ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no ♪ - I\\'d rather eat human shit! - Well, that\\'s what you\\'re gonna be eating if the planet heats another few degrees. - How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels when there\\'s Muslims out there? And Mexicans. There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know, and that\\'s a risk-- - Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you, when all the climate science in the world just bounces off that thick skull of yours? - So first of all, you people think everything is racist. And second, I guess I just need a villain, you know? Who\\'s the bad guy? Who am I afraid of? Who\\'s the other team? Your climate story has no antagonist. - Is that really what it\\'s gonna take? All right then. Why don\\'t you take a long, hard look out at the sea. - [Marie] Hi, mama. - [Doc] That\\'s right, there she is. Now look right over there. - Hello, mankind. It is I, your dark mother, the sea. And you, my children, have been an absolute disappointment. Every one of you is so pathetic. You make me want to throw up! Politicians, businessmen, and worst of all, environmentalists, ugh! The condescension of it all! You think you are capable of hurting me? Hah! I enjoy your so-called degradation. Your filthy air makes me hot. Your melting glaciers fill me up deep inside. And when you spew your filth all over, oh, it only makes me fucking wet. Every year my heaving bosom encroaches farther on your shores, and as I spat you out, my children, I will swallow you whole. I will take every inch of you inside of me and I will suck you down into the deep black pit of my wetness, you scum. And why? Because I am a slut. My progeny encompass the earth, and whatsoever I create, I shall destroy. For I, your deep, dark mother, am at once deliveress of your doom. And that\\'s why I vote Republican!

       " 13: ' (ominous music) - Death! Death, death, death, death! It\\'s the only thing everyone fears, and the only thing that gets me off. Hello, my devilish darlings, I am Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, your rare and radiant maiden of mayhem. Tonight\\'s program is about the death of meaning itself. The story is rather simple really, the he\\'s become she\\'s, and the she\\'s become he\\'s, and those and the middle are them and xem. And then, my dreadful dears, the Western world shall surely succumb to renewable energy, affordable healthcare, and video games for lesbians. (maniacal laughter) But there\\'s one man who stands in the way, the villain of tonight\\'s thriller. A meddling little cipher of a man. A man who prefers light to darkness, reason to madness, order to chaos. (scoffs) Can you imagine? His name is Ben Shapiro, and his catchphrase \"Facts don\\'t care about your feelings.\" Ugh! Can our heroine put a stop to this? Well, I\\'m just the executioner. You, my vile viewers, must be the judge. (ominous organ music) - Hi, girls. It\\'s me, Ms. Points. Mademoiselle Points. Words, words, words. What do they even fucking mean? Well I don\\'t know and I don\\'t care, but we have to talk about it anyway because of a boy named Ben Shapiro. So who is Ben Shapiro? Well, he\\'s a popular conservative pundit, the editor of The Daily Wire, and the auteur behind such Criterion Collection classics as \"Ben Shapiro Destroys Yale Snowflakes,\" \"Ben Shapiro Destroys Every College Snowflake Part Seven,\" \"Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College Snowflake,\" and \"Ben Shapiro Destroy Caitlyn Jenner.\" Ben\\'s especially notorious for his provocative, controversial, politically incorrect, snowflake-smashing refusal to call transgender people by their pronouns. - I\\'m willing to call Caitlyn Jenner \"Caitlyn Jenner.\" I\\'m not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a \"she.\" - Surprising, you might think, for a person so insistent on the value of civil discussion. - And let\\'s be civil, right? That\\'s the tone of the day. - I\\'m a fan. - But Ben seems to abandon civility in his discussions of trans people, preferring to fall back on his edgier mantra... - Facts don\\'t care about your feelings. And you know, on this one point, I actually agree with Ben. It\\'s true. Facts don\\'t care about my feelings. I dislike this trend toward regarding as a conclusive argument the proposition, \"This makes me feel invalidated.\" Because sometimes things that make you feel bad are true. It makes me feel bad that I used to be a sexy, sexy boy with rippling abs, but too fucking bad for me, because there I am, indelibly exhibited on YouTube for everyone to gawk at forever. Mmm, I was a yum yum tho. Build me a time machine doc. - We call this autoandrophilia, nurse. - What can I say, I like younger men. I\\'m a cougar in tiger\\'s clothing. (hisses) So look, I want to be treated like an adult. I don\\'t want to be indulged. If I\\'m delusional, I want to be disillusioned. I don\\'t want people lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories I need to tell myself to make it through the night. VO: It\\'s probably just dry down there. They\\'re just ingrown hairs. I\\'m sure plenty of healthy people have blood in their urine. - I don\\'t want my gender to be tolerated in the way that liberal Christians tolerate other of course false and heathen religions. I am an evangelical transsexual. I don\\'t want toleration, dammit, I want converts. - Excuse me sir, do you have a moment to talk about my womanhood? Sure, go ahead. Touch it. - So look, Shapiro. Benny. Baby. I invite you to disenchant all my fairy tales, to melt away every crystal of my snowflakery and henceforth dispense only the most scalding tea. Alright, big boy? Let\\'s have it. - I\\'m willing to call Caitlyn Jenner \"Caitlyn Jenner,\" I\\'m not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a \"she.\" Because you can\\'t change your sex, you can change your name. Caitlyn Jenner is a man, a biological man. And if he were born with high doses of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman. You\\'re determined by your chromosomes. So the argument is that what it means to be a \"she\" is to have a normal female karyotype, that is, XX sex chromosomes. And if you don\\'t have that karyotype, then you\\'re not a \"she,\" and to call you she would be tantamount to a lie. - I was wondering what you see the detriment of society like why we can\\'t let a transgender like woman be called \"she\" or something? - Because it is a lie. - So since you think calling a trans woman \"she\" is a lie, and you think that what it means to be \"a she\" is to have a normal female karyotype, then you must think that when we call a trans women \"she\" we are saying that she has a normal female karyotype. But hold on, I\\'m a transgender woman, and I\\'ve never claimed to have a normal female karyotype, and yet my friends, lovers, and most strangers call me \"she, \"her, miss, ma\\'am, girlfriend, ladies. \"Good girl, good girl, just like that, \"don\\'t stop, don\\'t stop.\" Are all of us deluded about my biology? No. It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro, it is you who misunderstands language. You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology, which it is not. We all agree on the biology. The actual subject of debate is the proper use of words such as \"he\", \"she\", \"man\" and \"woman\". But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word? Well, there are two kinds of arguments we could make, descriptive or prescriptive. If we take the descriptive approach then what we must do is act like anthropologists and study the way a word, for instance \"she,\" is used by a linguistic community. And whatever the social convention is is what\\'s correct. But if we take the prescriptive approach, then we must make an argument about the way the word \"she\" SHOULD be used, meaning we either defer to an authority such as the dictionary, or my ruler on you wrist you naughty boy, or we must have some goal that we want to accomplish by approving some uses of the word, and prohibiting others. Now if we take the descriptive approach, you lose, Ben Shapiro, because most people call me she, and that\\'s all there is to it. What\\'s more, your usage of \"a she\" and \"a he\" is ungrammatical. You don\\'t put an article before a pronoun, that\\'s not how pronouns work you silly dumdum. Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905, while the English pronouns \"he\" and \"she\" originate in the Proto-Germanic language spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe beginning around 500 BCE. Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person pronouns of the English language refer specifically to karyotype, it is you and not I who is breaking from linguistic tradition, Ben Shapiro. However, as a trans woman, it\\'s not generally in my interest to defer to traditions. So, let\\'s try out a prescriptive approach. Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used, how do we decide how a word should be used? Language is by nature ambiguous, and the way we attempt disambiguate it is often motivated by political goals. Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women \"she\" because his political goal is to reinforce rigid conservative gender roles. Whereas, I think we should call trans women she because my political goal is to live in a society where I can achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else. It\\'s analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage from a decade ago. Opponents argued that the dictionary and legal definition of marriage was union between a man and a woman, and the definition shouldn\\'t be changed because it\\'s the definition, and... \"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN TO MY CHILD?\" And on the other hand, gay people argued that the definition should be changed because they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else. And they succeeded. Because as it turns out, you can in fact change the definitions of words. The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it\\'s not the Bible. And for that matter, you can even change the Bible. I mean have you read the Contemporary English Version? The prose is atrocious, appalling. I won\\'t stand for this. But unlike the debate about gay marriage, the question about trans womanhood is more than just a political and legal dispute. It seems to me that whatever church, state, and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women are already women and will continue to be women. And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime rival Blaire White. Yes, even though she\\'s one of the YouTubers whomst is bad. The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting his usual position that pronouns are used to designate so-called biological men and biological women. Blaire responds by observing that Ben\\'s way of using pronouns is in her case completely impractical. - Well, if you and I were to go to a business dinner or any kind of dinner and you were meeting me at a restaurant and I was there first and I was in an orange shirt. And you had to tell the host, \"I\\'m here to meet my friend Blaire,\" and they said, \"Okay,\" and you had to describe me to take you to the table, you wouldn\\'t say, \"The man in the orange shirt,\" you would say, \"Blaire\" and you would say, \"Her over there.\" - Ben then responds saying. - I think there\\'s some truth to that, meaning that, I think that there is a utility to the use of pronouns but that\\'s not quite the same as suggesting that a transgender woman is a she in the objective sense. - And Blaire responds to that with what I think is a very good analogy. - For instance, if someone were to adopt children, there\\'s no biological basis for calling them that kids parents because they\\'re not. Like they\\'re just literally not, there\\'s no link at all biologically. But there is a social reason to do it and there\\'s a legal reason to do it. - Let\\'s expand on that analogy. Suppose you\\'re an adoptive parent, and you\\'re arguing with someone who says your adopted child isn\\'t really your child and you aren\\'t really a parent. As evidence, they point to the dictionary definition of parent, \"one that begets or brings forth offspring.\" \"You did not beget or bring forth offspring,\" they argue, \"therefore, you are not a parent. \"Facts don\\'t care about your feelings. \"No matter how much you love and care for this child, \"you\\'ll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.\" I think it\\'s clear, that the person who makes this argument is being uncivil, yes, being provocative, controversial, politically incorrect. But they\\'re not just impolite. They\\'re also wrong. Because an adoptive parent is, socially and functionally, just as real a parent as a biological parent. And to say otherwise is not just rude, it\\'s false. So, what do you have to say to that Ben Shapiro? - I would say that we actually do have different descriptions for adoptive parents than biological parents. You\\'ll say in shorthand that they\\'re parents because they\\'re all different types of parents. But we do say adoptive parents. - Right. Adoptive parents. An entirely valid type of parent. To call them parents is not a lie. - And then the question becomes, okay, exactly is the context that you were suggesting matters. In what context are we talking about the parents? Are we talking about a PTA meeting. Okay, this person is the legal guardian and therefore the parent. Because parenting has two aspects, there\\'s the biological parentage and then there\\'s the actual role of parenting. - So yes, there are some contexts where we do need to distinguish between biological and adoptive parents. For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child\\'s risk of some hereditary disease, they need to know if the parents are adoptive or biological. But at the PTA meeting and in most other contexts, it doesn\\'t matter in the slightest. - In the dinner conversation the same thing sort of holds true. Meaning, there is the biological role of woman, which you are not and then there is the you look like a woman, which is I\\'m gonna describe you as a woman to the waiter when he comes to direct me to the table. - Just when Ben seems on the cusp of having a breakthrough, he and Blaire pause their argument to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is. - From what I\\'ve seen a lot of your interactions with trans people they always end up kind of ugly. You know what I mean? There was, I think the person\\'s name was Zoey Tur There was that threat of physical violence. - What are you genetics, sir? - You cut that out now or you\\'ll go home in an ambulance. - And what\\'s hilarious about this, Blaire is, literally the exact same thing that I\\'m saying to you right now is exactly what I said to Zoey Tur on the air. - But that\\'s not exactly true, is it, Ben? Zoey threatened you after you called her sir. And you didn\\'t call Blaire sir, did you? Why did you call Zoey \"sir\"? What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit, O distinguished destroyer of snowflakes? I suppose you were just sticking to the facts. I suppose \"sir\" is a strictly biological term. Queen Guinevere said in days of old, \"I knight thee Lancelot, thou that art karyotypically male.\" - And you\\'re exactly right. When people start yelling at each other or tweeting out \"FU\", that\\'s not a great way to change my mind, it turns out that\\'s not particularly convincing. - So what is a great way to change your mind, Ben Shapiro? Did Blaire budge you an inch with her rationality, her even-temper, her civility, her aesthetic? It doesn\\'t seem like she did. At the end of this debate you regurgitate your original position undigested. - You know, I\\'m the editor of a pretty major site and my basic rule is that when were discussing people who are trans we immediately say in the first paragraph \"trans woman\" and then refer to them by their biological pronoun because biology is the nature of the pronoun. - \"Biology is the nature of the pronouns?\" Didn\\'t Blaire just demonstrate to you that in most contexts that\\'s not true for her? Remember the analogy of adoptive parents. There are some contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between adoptive parents and biological parents. Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between transgender and cisgender, or as you say \"biological\" women, for instance when discussing who needs access to certain reproductive healthcare you think should be illegal. But does this apply to pronouns? That is, are pronouns technical biological terms denoting karyotypes, or are they part of the everyday language we use to describe each other socially? The answer is obvious. There are no geneticists studying pronouns. In fact, there\\'s not a single biology textbook with a chapter on the difference between \"a he\" and \"a she.\" There is no such thing as \"biological pronouns.\" This is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people. So, as a trans woman, I\\'m reintegrating myself into society as a woman. She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me regardless of my anatomy, which is none of your business, Ben Shapiro, fascinating though it is. And just as it is incorrect to tell an adoptive mother that her son is not her child, to call me \"he\" is not just rude or insensitive. It is, in effect, false. But it is also rude and insensitive, so even if you don\\'t agree with me, you could still not. What\\'s the harm, right? - I teach my almost 4-year-old girl that she can become a boy, then I think that is not only lying to her, I think it\\'s confusing her and I think it\\'s damaging to her psyche. - Oh yes, the classic argument, \"HOW DO I EXPLAIN TO MY CHILD?\" Kill your shitty child for all I care, that\\'s simply not my problem. I regret every night I spent with you Ben Shapiro. I\\'m in a new relationship now with a lesbian. You and I are through! I\\'m getting an abortion and you can\\'t stop me! - It\\'s disgusting what they allow on TV these days. I won\\'t allow my children to watch movies unless there\\'s at least a bloodbath, or maybe an orgy. But hey, I don\\'t choose this schlock, I just present it. The second program of tonight\\'s science fiction double feature is about a cult of chaos hellbent on destroying Western civilization. I sure hope there\\'s more sex and violence this time. - Hi, boys. It\\'s Points again, same queen, new look. Try to keep up. In my previous video, \"Nasty T-babe Likes It Rough, I made an argument about why it\\'s correct to call trans women \"she,\" but I\\'d be bullshitting you if I only discussed fully integrated binary trans people. Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already. Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort to continue the charade of misgendering them. - The transgender woman from Orange Is the New Black. - [Joe] I never watched that show. - I\\'ve never watched that show either, but she\\'s on a cover of Time magazine. - [Joe] Oh. - Or he\\'s on the cover of Time magazine. [airhorns \"Turn Down For What\"] - I limited my argument to trans women who look the way society expects a woman to look, because cis people have an easier time making sense of that. But the reality is that in a lot of cases it\\'s a little more complicated. Now, as far as early transition trans people go, I am fairly integrated. Society basically gets that I\\'m a woman. Without me having to explain my gender, strangers usually default to \"she\", \"her\", \"miss\", \"ma\\'am\", \"Hey, haven\\'t I seen your videos on TgirlLove.com?\" But the truth is, I don\\'t pass perfectly. I got called \"sir\" last week by the cashier at H&M. Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M but needless to say, it was a desperate emergency, and by emergency, I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang\\'s. And what happened next stays between me and the Lord, but suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched in... Okay, I embellished the story a little. He wasn\\'t cute. So between being six foot one, the horrific transsexual squawking I try to pass off as my voice, and my tragic inability to conduct myself in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding, your girl remains, despite my desperate painstaking efforts, somewhat clockable. You look great, hon. In that debate between Ben and Blaire, Blaire says that pronoun usage boils down to what you look like. - But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like. - And it\\'s true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you largely based on your appearance. So appearance definitely matters, but in my opinion passing, in the sense of looking like a cis woman, isn\\'t really the most important thing. What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give off, the way you speak, the gestures, the conversational dynamic. That kind of stuff to me is what makes a person viscerally seem like a man or a woman. So my goal isn\\'t necessarily to serve unclockable fish so much as to embody a certain kind of diaphanous archetypal femininity, in layman\\'s terms, girl dick energy. Also I am gonna have a lot of plastic surgery, thank God. Last month I released a video called \"Sexy Furry Pounded by Skinny TBabe,\" and a lot of trans people got mad at me because they thought I was saying that performing your gender is the only thing that matters, and that how you identify counts for nothing. But that\\'s not what I think. I do prefer to argue that trans women are women because we live the lives of women, because I think that\\'s a much more compelling argument than, \"I\\'m a woman because I psychologically identify as a woman,\" which in my experience doesn\\'t really persuade anyone, it\\'s just too easy to poke holes in it. But identity definitely does matter, especially when it comes to pronouns, and I\\'ll explain why. Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people are very sensitive about anyone telling them what pronouns to use. So I\\'m gonna try to be respectful of your feelings, and what a difficult and personal issue this must be for you. After all, we live in a repressive political era, despite the best efforts of hero professor Jordan B. Peterson. But alas, he was too late, now we have has Bill C-16 which compels speech and sends people to jail for... Oh, it\\'s been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed? Let\\'s check in on how many people have gone to jail for pronoun misuse. (dramatic instrumental music) Oh. Guess that, uh, guess that was a false alarm, huh. Goddammit. Look, I\\'m not gonna tell you what pronouns you have to use. I\\'m just going to tell you how I use pronouns and my reasoning behind it, and you are welcome to use your free speech to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you wanna be. Okay? So, back to identity. If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets and a customer were to walk in looking like this, I might ordinarily default to female pronouns. But that would be wrong, since I happen to know this person is not only a man, he is the man. YouTube\\'s most regal makeup artist, his Lordship John Maclean, and he uses he/him pronouns. Likewise, if I were approached by this person, I\\'d fall in love and then default to female pronouns, and this time I\\'d be correct, but not because she\\'s a cis woman or a trans woman, but because she\\'s genderfluid drag queen Courtney Act, who has the fucking audacity to be a more beautiful woman than I am, and who so far as I know uses male pronouns in boy mode and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens. A lot of the complexities of gender, language, identity, and expression get played out in the world of drag. Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men who live as men and perform as women. Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinkx Monsoon, Shea Coulee and Violet Chachki identify as non-binary. Others still are bio queens, cis women who perform as drag queens, like Lucy Garland or Creme Fatale. And then there are trans women who are also drag queens like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or for that matter, me. I mean, look at me. You think I dress like this when I go to 7-Eleven at 2AM? Because I do. Look what I\\'ve become, a bisexual transsexual drag queen. Look, I didn\\'t intend to become this much of a snowflake, I, just through pure coincidence happen to be the most interesting and unique person who ever lived, I\\'m so sorry, I can\\'t help it. So let\\'s recap, there are gender non-conforming men who present very femme but use male pronouns, there are cis men who use female pronouns whenever they present female, there are genderfluid people who use different pronouns depending on their current presentation, there are pre-transition trans people who identify as a gender other than the one they present and live as and prefer other pronouns. So you really can\\'t just rely on the way a person looks, because there\\'s a lot of situations where the way they look doesn\\'t tell you the whole story. So as you can see, identity is definitely important, but it\\'s also not the only thing that matters. If psychological identity were the only thing that mattered then there would be no need for a trans person to come out or do anything to transition, including requesting different pronouns, because pronouns belong to the social world of language, not to individual psychology. This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video. You can identify however you like, but gender is also social, structural and interpersonal. So if for example you\\'re a trans woman still living as a man, then you are fully trans, your identity is fully valid, but until you begin living as a woman your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical. And when I say living as a woman, I don\\'t mean passing. There\\'s too much emphasis on physical appearance and not enough on social relationships. You know, you don\\'t become a woman the first time you put on a dress, you become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant and says, \"Maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.\" My point is not to invalidate anyone\\'s identity. As far as I\\'m concerned if a trans person hasn\\'t transitioned yet they are fully trans. I\\'m trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of a people\\'s gendered experience isn\\'t entirely a product of how they identify. Put it this way, I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman, but my thought process behind it isn\\'t always the same. Many trans women just seem like to women to me, in literally the same way that cis women seem like women, and I use female pronouns for them effortlessly just as I was trained to do from birth. This I think is the goal for most binary trans people. We want not necessarily to pass perfectly, but at least to seem like our genders to the people around us. As Laura Jane Grace put it, \"You want them to see you like they see every other girl.\" I want people calling me she not out of politeness or respect for my identity as a trans woman but just because I seem like a woman to them. Because the reality is not all trans women seem like women to me in that visceral way, and I live with this constant crushing anxiety that I don\\'t seem like a woman to other people. I\\'m terrified of looking like third-rate drag queen, and I cope with that fear by looking like a second-rate drag queen. But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears zero percent woman, if she tells me she\\'s a trans woman, I\\'m gonna use female pronouns, no matter what she looks like. Not just to be polite, but also because I want to recognize the reality of her psychological experience. And especially because I want to help her resocialize and reintegrate into the world as her true gender. And of course, cis people, you have legally the freedom to refuse to do that, but if you refuse you are being a shitgibbon. And I would prefer that you not be a shitgibbon. Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room. An increasing number of people identify not as male or female, but as non-binary, an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, greygender, and so on. Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun, in English, usually \"they.\" Now if your first impulse is to argue that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense, consider that having gendered singular third-person pronouns at all is a particular feature of the English language that\\'s by no means shared by all other languages, including Turkish, Korean and Finnish, which don\\'t have them at all. Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth that humans make up to suit our purposes. If you\\'re new to using singular \"they,\" it\\'s a little confusing at first, but with some practice it gets pretty easy. V.O: They poured milk on me. I poured milk on them. They did anoint themself in their milk and it was good, thus saith the Lord. - So the polite thing to do here is easy. If someone asks you to call them \"they,\" you call them \"they.\" But, if you\\'re like me, you don\\'t want to just do a thing because you dogmatically believe it\\'s the woke thing to do. You want to understand why you\\'re doing it. I don\\'t just want to tolerate non-binary people. I want to be a convert, I want to believe about them what they believe about themselves, so long as those beliefs are reasonable. So what do all these words mean? What are these people talking about? Remember earlier we distinguished gender expression from gender identity. John Maclean is feminine in expression but a man in identity. Whereas I am a woman in identity and in expression I am a mess. Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture\\'s great contributions to humanity, art, science, spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the futch scale. The futch scale is a diagram that looks like this and quantifies from 1 to 10, or high femme to stone butch, the gender expression of a given domain, such as Mulan looks or Steven Universe characters. It can also be used more abstractly for weapons, fish Pokemon or wind instruments. Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do with words like genderqueer, agender, greygender, and so on, is to give to identity the same kind of specificity the futch scale gives to expression. But my input on this isn\\'t really worth that much, because I\\'m not non-binary. And to tell you the truth, I kind of feel for cis people here, because all this talk about gender identity, a lot of the time I don\\'t really get it either. I look inside myself and ask, \"Do I feel like a man or a woman?\" And after all these years the answer is still that I feel like shit. And that\\'s how I experience gender, I live, I exist as a woman, which is the only way I can achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else. And I identify as trash. I guess there are certain moments that makes me feel like a natural woman, oh, listening to Aretha Franklin, the pain and ecstasy of penetration, waiting in a long-ass line for the restroom, a big strong arm around my waist, being asked if I have any tampons, having tampons in case someone asks, a dude explaining Philosophy 101 to me and me going, \"Oh, really? Wow!\" But you know, these experiences mean different things to different people, so all I can really tell you is that I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures, that taking female hormones and having feminizing medical procedures makes me feel more at home in my body, and that I like when other people treat me as a woman, socially, spiritually, sexually. So that\\'s the jargon-free explanation of my gender as I see it. Am I really, truly a woman, ontologically, neurologically, metaphysically? Well, honestly I don\\'t even know what that would mean. But I do know that the life I live as a woman is the only life I have, and that, I think, is legitimate enough. So, I know what living as a woman means to me, but what does it mean to live a non-binary life? Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman, that\\'s something that\\'s going to vary between individuals and cultures. Some cultures have ancient third-gender traditions, such as the hijra of South Asia, a legally recognized gender in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, or the various two-spirit traditions of indigenous North American tribes. Non-indigenous American culture doesn\\'t have a third-gender tradition, but we do have individual non-binary people, some of whom are making content that has taught me a lot about non-binary experience, non-binary bodies and non-binary life. We have a lot in common, binary and non-binary trans people. Even as a binary trans person, I used to live as one gender and now I live as another gender. That in itself is a pretty serious challenge to the stability of the binary. But many of the people who call themselves non-binary seem to be fighting for something more radical than what I\\'m fighting for, at least in my personal life. I\\'m just trying to assimilate into a pre-existing female gender role. As you can see by the normal way I\\'m dressed. The traditional female garb of my culture. No. Whereas, non-binary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely, they\\'re effectively trying to create the society that includes them. And sometimes that puts me at cross purposes with some non-binary people, who, for example, promote the practice of always asking for someone\\'s pronouns. Whereas, I love it when people assume my gender, provided they assume it correctly, otherwise I will throw you in imaginary Canadian pronoun jail. But what we all agree on is that many trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming people find it easier to navigate the world using pronouns other than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you to use. So if you want me to call you \"they\" I\\'m gonna call you \"they.\" And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer, to do or say anything, I do hope you use your free will to freely choose to use your freedom of speech to choose to do the same. Freely. - Well, at least there was a hideous monster this time. (whispering) I\\'m talking about the female lead. Now the fun really begins, the show\\'s over. I\\'m gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor. So goodbye my satanic subscribers and till next week, go to hell! (upbeat electronic music) \"Hand in Hand\" by Zoë Blade (static)',\n",
       " 14: ' [static] [V.O.] In color theory, the selection of colors used in a design is called a color scheme. Analogous color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel. - Hi girls! I’m Tracy Mounts, guest host of ContraPoints, the Internet show where we talk about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults. This week we’ll be talking about (tongue pop) colors. [bell sweep] Colors, what the fuck are they? In one beaker I have white, in the other brown. Pour them together and, well, I don’t know what the kids are calling it. It’s delicious! Now to according to some so-called experts color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. But what about the shadow illusion? Same wavelengths, different colors. Some people say I’m a man dressed as a lady, but I’m actually a lady who used to be a man, dressed as a man dressed as a lady. Explain that Professor Butler. Illusions! What matters more, the way things are or the way things look? Let’s watch an instructional video to learn more. [static] [ominous electronic music] - Hi, I’m Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report um… it’s too early for this. Today my guests are um… *sigh* Well who are you people? - I’m Dr. Abigail Cockbane, associate professor of women’s studies and author of many, many books, most recently my doctoral thesis, Sacred Passage: The Divine Feminine in Flux and Flow. - Oooooooh yes. And uh, well you look familiar, who are you? - (hisses) - Okay. Well. Today my guests will be debating the topic ummm... Well here’s a good one: should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for a transgender? What do you think Annabel? - Well Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender begins with freedom of speech. For instance, this cat person over here is clearly a biological male in some sort of costume wig. Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes, but the fact remains that pronouns refer, as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex. But perhaps you disagree, sir. - That’s a human rights violation! I’ll smash your fucking face! [hiss] - And here we have a clear illustration of the way that transgender ideology is merely a smokescreen for male violence against women, and mind you this is being taught in our schools, it’s being forced on our children, it’s become mandatory in every workplace… - Security, have this cat removed. - [continued hissing] - Dissenters are being silenced, and something must be done about the encroaching trans agenda, taking away women’s rights, invading women’s spaces, depriving us of what feminism has worked so hard— [static] - I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a cat. Gender’s just like color. Some people see yellow, some people see blue. It’s all a matter of opinion. Or is it? It’s not. Let’s hear the real tea. [static] [ominous electronic music] - Tabby. Sweetie, baby, princess. - I feel ridiculous in this dress. - Yeah well you look ridiculous, because you wouldn’t take the goddamn cat ears off. - I think I’m gonna take the dress off. - Well don’t do that. I’m trying to help you out girl. If you don’t want to get misgendered it helps to fem it up a little. - I’m gonna take it off. Well don’t leave… You can change in front of me, I’m not a prude. - I’m gonna go behind the curtain. - (whines) I like looking at naked people. - Why do you always hit on me, I thought you were into men. - Well I swing both ways. I like boy dick and girl dick. - That’s not how that works. I hate that. - The heart wants what it wants. - Why did you invite me over here anyway? - I saw what happened to you on the Freedom Report and girl. Girrrrl. You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening people with a bat. - You think it’s morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors? - Pff. No. “Morally wrong”—what does that even mean? It was much worse than morally wrong. It was aesthetically wrong. It was unfeminine. - This is all you ever say to me. “It’s bad optics, it\\'s bad aesthetics.” Well does reality matter at all to you? Because the reality is I am a woman, and maybe a bunch of ignorant people don’t think I look like one, but the way things look isn’t all that matters. - Tabby, this is politics. Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter? Reality plays no role in politics. Politics is aesthetics. - “Politics is aesthetics”? That’s literally what fascism is. Have you even read Benjamin? - Ugh. - “Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.” The military parades, the pageantry. And Communism responds by politicizing art. - This is what I can’t stand about communists, you want to turn art into propaganda. - Well art is already ideology. - Ugh. Look, instead of ruining art why don’t we just fight the pageantry of fascism with pageantry of our own. And you know who’s gonna make that happen? - Who? - Well funded trans women. My Patreon’s in the description. - Ew. Stop that. - What? I’m just trying to monetize a connected engagement community by strategically leveraging my content creator promotional media brand analytics. Is that so wrong? - You’re so bougie. - I’m not the one quoting German philosophers from memory. - Revolutionary philosophers. - Whatever you need to tell yourself. Look, the point I’m trying to make is that the world we live in is not a philosophical world. Think about Instagram. It’s all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle. If you cry yourself to sleep every night who cares. No one sees that, they only see the show you’re putting on. - Okay but life is not a show. - Mmm—politics is a show. Look around you Tabby, try to understand what’s happening to the world. The president of the United States is a reality TV star. The 21st century is an aesthetic century. In history there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle, and it’s important to know which you’re in. Our America, our Internet is not ancient Athens. It’s Rome. And your problem is you think you’re in the forum when you’re really in the circus. - I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent, now you’re against reason too? - I’m not against reason. Reason is a very powerful aesthetic—if you’re a man. - And what if you’re a woman? - Oh don’t be a woman. That’s not a good idea. - [Sips] Ow. - Do you remember that YouTube debate between Blaire White and that YouTuber with the pink wig, what was her name? I don’t know, she was relevant back in 2017. Anyway this was before she transitioned and in that debate Blaire looked like she had two X chromosomes and the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig not looking at the camera. - I vaguely remember. I think I wrote an angry blog post about it. - Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad. It was embarrassing to watch. - Not really. I mean she was right, and her arguments were better. - [cackles] Tabby. Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby. Arguments don’t matter. How pretty you are matters. - Is this really where you’re going with this? - Tabby, if you want to be a public figure, sooner or later you\\'re gonna need to take the trans girl blackpill. - Oh boy. - If you’re a trans woman in the public eye, what matters is one thing and one thing only. And it’s always been the thing that matters. - What? - The realness. Verisimilitude. You have to look like a fucking woman. - There it is. - \"There it is\" is right. We don’t say it in public, but we all know it, and we all feel it. - What does it even mean to look like a woman? Oh don’t give me that PC bullshit, I’m trying to have a real conversation here. We all know what it means. - I don’t know what it means. Women have a lot of different looks. There are bald women, bearded women, muscular women, wide-shouldered women— - And what is society’s opinion about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women? - Is this just about you making me wear the dress again? - The dress is the last of my concerns. I mean where do I even start with this? You’re wearing combat boots. You cannot be wearing combat boots. - Why not? A lot of cis women wear them. - Cis women? Well they’re hopeless aren’t they. Fully clockable. - So you want me to look like a woman without imitating cis women. - Yes. Do not under any circumstances imitate cis women. They have no idea what they’re doing. - Well where does your idea of womanhood even come from then? - Das Ewig-Weibliche. The archetype of the eternal feminine. - And where does that come from? - Poets… teenage gay boys on Instagram. The only people with any coherent vision of contemporary womanhood. - That’s insanity. - Is it? Tabby look at my face. Look at this highlight. [Chimes] [Ding!] Does that look like the product of insanity to you? - I mean yeah, kind of. Who puts on that much make up to drink tea at home? - Good banter, well done. But trans women have to overdo it. You need to be so good at makeup that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice. You need to toss your hair and cross your legs. You need to smile, even at people who hate you. Eliminate every aggressive impulse. You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream. Your hands are not tools, they are ornaments on the ends of your arms. - So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are. Literally a man’s idea of a woman. - Well, men have the power, men make the rules, and it’s ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood. So you can’t really blame me for having to deal with that situation. - I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes. - Not stereotypes. Performances. You like philosophy so much, haven’t you read Judith Butler? Gender is performance. We’re all born naked and the rest is literally drag. Womanhood is not what you are, it’s what you do. And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning. - So according to you there’s no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen? - No, you’re misinterpreting what I’m saying. I don’t mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you’re not. I mean performance in the sense of everything you do, the way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak. An authentic performance is just a habitual performance, and nothing more than that. - So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women? - I mean, isn’t that kind of what it felt like? You transition the same way get anywhere in life: you fake it till you make it. - So according to you a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen. That’s what any woman is. - What about gender non-conforming cis women. They’re not “doing womanhood” in that way. - Well, yeah, that’s why those women are marginalized. They’re going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood. And you don’t want to end up like that do you? - And hold on. Are you saying if a cis man dresses like a woman, talks like a woman, takes female hormones, is gendered female by other people, and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman, then he’s literally just as much a woman as we are? - Yep. - That’s absurd. - But it’s absurd because the example is absurd. No cis man would do that. It’s like asking, \"Is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men?\" Like yeah, pretty much. See this is philosophy at its worst, pointless speculative fiction. And it’s a distraction from what we’re really talking about, which is you getting rid of those combat boots. - I thought we were talking about philosophy. - No. We’re talking about shoes. - Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you? You’re apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends. - The left will abide a regal queer. - Look your performance theory doesn’t explain why trans people exist in the first place. If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors, then why did we reject our male upbringings and decide to live as women? What matters is that we identify as women. We can express that identity in different ways, but it’s the identity, not the performance, that makes us women. - But you can’t be a woman without performing womanhood. Without action, and without social recognition, the identity is meaningless. If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter. Because unless you’re living womanhood, the identity is literally that meaningless. - That’s very unfair to pre-transition trans people. Well this isn’t a Tumblr cuddle party girl, I’m trying to talk about what’s really true. I didn’t say it was insensitive, I said it was unfair. - Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality that implies a potential to live your inner truth. - No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter, it’s just a troll example. - True. But even if they were sincere there would be no reality to it because helicopter is not an actual social role. Whereas you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman. But you have to work to get there, and ultimately society has to let you. - What do you mean? I can identify as doctor and go around handing out diagnoses, but if no one recognizes me as a doctor then I’m not really practicing medicine, am I? - But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment, all it takes is being misgendered. - It’s scary but isn’t that the situation we’re in? Why did you get so angry when that TERF called you “sir”? Isn’t it because in that situation she robbed you of your womanhood? - That’s ridiculous. I am a woman. That’s my reality. It doesn’t depend on other people’s opinions. - I know you’re a woman. I’m just saying in that one moment, you effectively had your gender canceled. Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational. Either you’re perceived as a woman, or you aren’t. There’s no reasoning your way into it. - Oh don’t worry about that. I don’t argue I’m a woman. I smash. - I know you do. And it’s a bad look. - Is this about the shoes again? Yep. Here, put these on. - Absolutely not, I’m not wearing those. Yes you are bitch. - No. - If you put them on I’ll um... scratch you behind the ears later. - Okay fine. - Now walk. [sigh] [house music] [distressed hissing and meowing, house music continues] - That was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. - Well you’re the one who made me do it! - Look, don’t stomp around like that. Keep your shoulders back and steady. All the movement comes from your hips. And you wanna put the weight on the balls of your feet. Here I’ll show you. [house music] Your turn. Do it right. [sigh] The category is… catgirls. [House music] Yes bitch. That was flawless, it was iconic. I’m living for this. I’m loving this for you. You’re doing so good for yourself. - I’m never doing that again. - Ugh! Why not? - Because it’s not who I am. All your advice is just trying to turn me into you. Well that’s not what aesthetics is. Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth. And I’ll only ever be a second-rate Justine, but I can be a first-rate Tabby. - Well kids this week we learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being yourself— - Shut up. Look, I know I’m not cool okay. I know I’m not pretty. And I know you think you’re too good for me because you mostly pass. And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back. People stare at me because I’m a transgender furry and that’s weird. But I’m a fucking queer icon because I’m not like you, because I’m not like anyone but myself, and because I’m willing to stand up to the people who oppress us, and I’m willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow and deep voices, the girls even other trans women make fun of, and when in the history of the world has anyone but me ever stood up for them? That’s why everyone knows who Tabby is. When was the last time anyone talked about Justine? - Wow, Tabby. I didn’t know you had that in you. But so what? So male-to-anime Twitter stans you, big deal. - You’re mad, aren’t you? I’ll get over it in a few weeks. Look, you’re right. You have to be yourself. Trying to be someone else is always a bad look. So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic then wear them well and make it work. But sometimes being yourself is not enough. Sometimes you have to become yourself. And for you I think that means that the smashing has got to stop. I mean with the Nazis it’s one thing but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat. - I wouldn’t have to smash if literally anyone else were willing to stick up for us. Your delicate notion of femininity is a product of the privilege you share with a lot of thin white cis feminists. - Wow, it must be so hard for you out on the streets as a fat woman of color. - Shut up. - I’m just saying, don’t claim a struggle that isn’t yours girl. You could have what I have, you just have to work for it instead of playing this part of the tragic victim. You were raised a white boy. You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy. And yeah it’s hard being a trans woman of any background but you still stand on a lot of privilege. I look at all the photos of trans women who are murdered in this country, and they don’t look like you or me. Why don’t you use your privilege and use your education to actually do some good in the world instead of this elective revolutionary LARPing. - You make me seem like the self-indulgent one. I’m sorry I’m not hardworking enough to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes. - I’ve seen minds change and hearts soften before my eyes. You don’t win friends and allies with a bat. - They’re just using you. - Well who do you think benefits, and who do you think is hurt when you go out into the world and represent trans women as masculine and violent? - Who do you think benefits when they trot you out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent? - I guess we can’t win can we. Wanna just chill out and watch YouTube videos? - Yeah, okay. - Forget about the disrespect. Facts don’t care about your feelings. It turns out that every chromosome, every cell in Caitlyn Jenner’s body is male with the exception of some of his sperm cells. -You don’t know what you’re talking about, you’re not educated on genetics. - Would you like to discuss the genetics? What are your genetics sir? - You cut that out now or you’ll go home in an ambulance. - Now that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion. You cut that out now or you’ll go home in an ambulance. - So I look at that and I feel like on my end it\\'s like I’m always, I feel like I’m always damage-controlling for the trans community which is so frustrating. - (chuckles) - You’ll go home in an ambulance - Damage controlling, so frustrating - (chuckles) - You’ll go home in an ambulance - Damage controlling, so frustrating - (chuckles) [looped phrases continue] - It’s imperative that we actually use terms that refer to something. If you want to talk about gender as distinct from sex, and then talk about you’re a very feminine biological man and you’ve had the surgeries to prove it, then I think that we can talk about what is the appropriate pronoun to use. My problem is the— [static] - Tabby, I don’t want to fight with you. We’re surviving in this shit world together and you’ll always be my sister. - Well I’m glad. - I love you. - What? [Static] - Love. I was in love once. I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati bent over a pool table. The year was 1985. And to this day when the perfume of cheap whiskey hits my nostrils at just the right moment, I can almost feel the beer-stained billiard cloth against my cheek. Uhn!

       " 15: ' [Mendelssohn: String Quartet No. 6 in F minor, III. Adagio] [V.O] \"Imagine how a woman feels.\" “Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels. \"Imagine the sweet smell of her perfume. \"Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against yours. \"Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your [bleep] inside her, softly \"moaning as it slides in. \"Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm [bleep] wrapped around every inch of your [bleep]. \"Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every thrust. \"Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as she possibly \"can and begging you to [bleep] inside her as you release every ounce of your [bleep] \"into her. \"Then imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards, and looking \"beside you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you \"in the most intimate way possible. “You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in \"your face are not the proper shape. \"Have a nice day.” [Melancholic chill jazz] - Hello boys. Let’s talk about bone structure. [Chill music] There’s something basically Soviet about the way the Internet names things. Stalin had portmanteaus like \"agitprop\", \"politburo\", and \"kompromat\", and we have \"webinar\", \"podcast\", and \"incel\", short for \"involuntary celibate.\" The word \"incel\" was invented in the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who created a website called \"Alana\\'s Involuntary Celibacy Project\" that was essentially a safe space for people who just couldn’t get it in. But in our own miserable moment of Internet history, the word “incel” refers to a more specific community of mostly heterosexual men, centered around forums like Incel.me and r/braincels. This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press because for the last few years they’ve been churning out mass murderers faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies. But most incels aren’t violent killers. They’re just men who’ve formed an identity around not getting laid. In this video I don’t want to mock incels or lecture them or even sympathize with them. I just want to understand who they are and why they’re like this. To start with, sometimes the best way to understand a person’s world is to learn their language, and the language of the incels… well. You’ll see. 1st Base: Incelese Does it ever bother you that the word “women” makes adult females sound just a little bit too human? Well incels have a solution to that. They’ve taken to calling women \"feeeeeemoooooids.\" The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels think of women: not as sisters or mothers, and certainly not as autonomous people, but as a kind of foreign, inscrutable object, comparable to a natural resource—unobtainium—to which incels believe all men are entitled, and to which they feel they have been unjustly denied. There’s a long tradition of nerdy men talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways. I’m reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner von Braun’s remark about female astronauts: [V.O.] “We are reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment.” - Which is not to say that alpha males are less misogynistic than nerds, but simply that the nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny. Now “femoid” is about as neutral a term as incels have for women and it’s only downhill from there. There’s the usual standbys: \"bitches\", \"sluts\", \"whores\", all conveying a searing resentment of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which is represented by the bespoke incel coinage “roastie” which, I’m sorry to inform you, refers to the incel belief that the human vulva become mutilated through repeated penetration by different men—though not through repeated penetration by the same man interestingly—and thereby come to resemble roast beef. Now by definition, incels haven’t actually observed any vaginas, but to incels anatomy is more a matter of metaphysical speculation than crude science. Though, if you ask me the right metaphor for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes. Of course, not all feeeemooooids are created equal. There are various subspecies: - [David Attenborough style V.O.] The Becky, or normie femoid, is to be contrasted with the Stacy, or sexually desirable femoid, whose distinguishing features include “makeup on point; Never works a day in her life; Naturally curvy body gives men instant erections; big tits and ass show fertility. - Leave my buns alone you savages. The Stacy, naturally, has a male counterpoint, whom incels call the Chad. - [David Attenborough style V.O.] A Chad is a hunky alpha, whose hands are always prepared to grab nearby fertile pussy; he has never heard a song in his entire life; he has a sloped forehead with a strong brow, ram bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate. - It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad exhibiteth a brow ridge most pronounced whereas the skull of the virgin is most inadequate in this regard, predisposing such specimens to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry. - It’s time to talk about bone structure. According to a classic incel meme, - [David Attenborough style V.O.] “The difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally \"a few millimeters of bone.” - I would like to propose a sociological theory. Foppington’s law: Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community, it is only a matter of time before deep metaphysical significance is assigned to the shape of human skulls. Why skulls, you ask. Well, the best explanation I can come up with is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable. It’s therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics that bigots like to assign to certain groups of people. If you believe for example that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior, you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape a skull and saying, \"Well, that’s the reason why, it’s just nature, there’s nothing that can be done about it.\" And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy. Mankind is divided into two groups of people, the Chads with the fuckable skulls and the incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short. Corndog, anyone? I’m really hungry. Of course, it’s not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness. They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy. Heightcels are incel due to their inferior stature. Whereas mentalcels can’t attract women because of mental illness or autism, or they’re addicts and then called drugcels. Wristcels, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists. Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird. - [V.O.] “Oh yeah?\" \"Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist? \"Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist? \"But yeah, obviously ‘obsessing’ about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even \"many women’s is completely irrational body dysmorphia and the reason why no woman wants \"to be with me or even talk to me is my shitty personality even though literal 80 IQ men \"who have nothing to talk about except who won the game last night are still able to \"attract a loving partner.” - ...Interesting. A significant number of incels are not white, in which case their unfuckability is attributed to race, and they are accordingly termed, apologies in advance, blackcels, ricecels, currycels, and so on. Which is not to say all non-white men are celibate. There are of course the occasional Chads of color, with their superior skulls and towering stature, whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets. I’m so sorry. So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race, but what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach. Unless of course you delusionally imagine that you can “ascend,” that is, escape your inceldom. If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement, well, that makes you the lowest of the low, a sad and sorry hopecel. Second base: The Red Pill So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview: the Stacys, the Chads, the incels, and the normies. From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and of sexuality, which they call the Red Pill. Incels share the Red Pill worldview with the rest of the manosphere, that is, pick-up artists, men’s rights activists, and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their Own Way, abbreviated MGTOW. According to Red Pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous. Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying above, refers to the practice of seeking relationships with men above one’s social status, and also, in incel usage, above one’s attractiveness. According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the sexes. So, if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like to do, there would be about as many say 8/10 women as 8/10 men. Incels believe that in a just world, a 5/10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship with his looksmatch, that is, a 5/10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself. But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad. Incels sometimes call this the 80/20 rule, the idea that only the top 20% of men will ever be desired by women. Now since most heterosexual men do end up in relationships with women, you might be raising your eyebrow at that idea. But incels have an explanation. According to the Red Pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called \"Alpha Fux Beta Bux.\" This means that in her 20s a woman will, as incels say, ride the cock carousel, sleeping with as many Chads as possible. But as she ages into her 30s she will settle down with a beta normie, whom she’s not really attracted to, but whom she will use for financial support, all the while continuously cuckolding him on the alpha cock carousel, before inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything he’s worth in a divorce settlement, and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children and a new Chad boyfriend, while the beta cuck is left behind to fester in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty. So the upshot of the Red Pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes. Either you’re an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment, or you’re a normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife, who will divorce you, win custody of the children and run off will all your money. Or you could be an alpha—an independent, promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women and forms attachments to none of them. In the Red Pill philosophy there are two ways to become alpha. The first is simply to be a Chad by nature. The second is to become a pick-up artist. Redpilled pick-up artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe, that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable. The difference is that pick-up artists are not celibate, in fact they try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of strategies and scripts known as “game” as described by the book of that title, as well as by the red-pilled pick-up artist Roosh V, author of a book called— Bang, a new mascara from Benefit. So the tube is bomb, I am living. Let’s see what kind of wand it has. Oh...it’s so big. I wonder what Roosh is up to lately. - I bake my own bread. Yes, I’m outing myself as a baker, as someone who likes to cook. I’m not a woman. I am ultra masculine, as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing. And men like scientific things. I used to be a scientist. - Well, Roosh you know what? If it means you leave women alone then I hope you enjoy your new life as an ultra-masculine baker— sorry, I mean bread scientist. So remember the red pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20% or less of men are really attractive to women, dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism is a pretext for enabling women to behave however they want while consigning men to emasculation and impotence. The black pill is the additional realization that one’s place in the sexual marketplace is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships are forever out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible and there’s nothing one can do except Lie Down and Rot. The black pill is, essentially, dogmatic hopelessness about dating and about life in general. It is the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call catastrophizing: a cognitive distortion where anxiety or depression leads you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks and anxieties. For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I’m going to be late for work, and from there infer: my boss is going to be angry, I’m going to lose my job, I’m not going to able to get another job, I’m going to be unemployed forever, my family will starve, oh god we’re all going to die. Each step in the sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is completely absurd. This is exactly how the black pill works. You start with experiences of rejection and isolation. From there you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only option is to lie down and rot. Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do. On incel forms suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged “sui fuel” or “rope fuel” meaning that they make you want to kill yourself, usually because they’re reminders of how hopeless the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are missing out on the incredible bliss of sex and romance. Now if you suggest to incels that posting sui fuel on forums already populated with lonely and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that, \"Oh it\\'s \"just dark humor, it’s just a cope, throw us a bone here.\" But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor, and it’s common to see people express pretty extreme states of depression, which is not surprising, since hopelessness is the logical conclusion of the black pill worldview. One’s possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial bone structure. And if you don’t have these gifts there’s no relief but to cope or rope. Now—it’s pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids. You want to grab them by their Black Ops t-shirts, shake them a bit and tell them that there are millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they’re their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows maybe then they’ll develop a disposition that women find a little more approachable. Essentially, you want to tell them, \"Clean your room, bucko.\" In fact for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice, Jordan Peterson is probably helpful. Because he’s telling them a lot of what they need to hear, and he’s kind of a sexist old man so they might actually listen. But most incels don’t want to hear this kind of advice. In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression. You are, in effect, chadsplaining their oppression to them when you give basic advice like, \"be more confident,\" \"take a shower,\" to people who have already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation, and who believe they’ve already tried everything. So they despise this kind of advise, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility and insensitivity of it. - [V.O.] “Just go out to parties, bro!” “Instead of hating on women all day why don’t you losers just try being confident \"like this average looking guy? \"Confidence is key.” “You incels need some hobbies. \"Try reading some books, women love INTELLIGENCE! \"It works for me bro!” “Aw, you just need to get out more.” ♪ No one knows what it’s like to be hated ♪ - To incels, their worldview seems ironclad. It has built-in defenses against anyone who would try to change their minds. So if you want to understand incels, and in particular if you want to understand why their community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill is more than the dogma that you can’t get laid. It’s also the dogma that because you can’t get laid, you can never be happy. So what we have on our hands here is more than a bunch of angry Internet misogynists. It’s, at worst, a kind of a death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy. And it’s not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since triumph is impossible, why not try revenge? Third Base: Tinder is Garbage I know I said I wasn’t gonna sympathize with incels, and I know they don’t want my sympathy anyway, and I know it\\'s bad praxis to sympathize with the devil— but on some level I can’t help it. The Internet is for introverts, so I’m sure a lot of people watching this feel the same way. I bet some of you have been this guy. I’ve been this guy. So look, I’m gonna tell you something I’ve never really come out about on this channel, so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man. And I’m not proud of that but I’m ready to move on if you’re ready to forgive. I’m in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be a man who dates women. What kind of fucked up shit is that? Is that even allowed? Alright calm down lesbian stans I’m still attracted to women, and those who lieth betwixt, cats, the inherent eroticism of the sea. [Mendelssohn, Hebrides Overture] [V.O] Mmmm yeah. Don’t you just wanna get in there. Take me mommy! But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately. - I gotta get my hetero on! - What I’m getting at is I’ve used Tinder both as a man seeking women, and as a woman seeking men. And I think I that gives me some relevant experiences. When you’re a man the strategy is you’ve gotta send a lot of messages because women get a lot of messages, and then you’ve just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys. Whereas if you’re a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue and receive the inquiries. Let’s see how we’re doing here. How many men have liked me on Tinder? I’m paying $30 for this information so this better be good. I have 2500 likes. That’s a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped right on a tran. What a divine city! [Game show music] Awww that’s so nice of them to be interested in me. Let’s see what kind of messages I got. \"DICK OR NO DICK?\" \"PRE-OP OR POST-OP?\" \"DID YOU CUT YOUR DICK OFF?\" Oh my god. I’m gonna cut it off, okay? Jesus. I will let you smash my pussy so so hard, if you just be patient. it’s a whole process. - That’s not a pussy, that’s a fuck hole. You’ll never know what it means to squeeze life out of your sacred passage. - Well, that’s true. I’m not squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong. And I assure you that none of the passages I have down there ever have been or ever will be sacred. Abigail, leave my fuck hole out of this. When I first started using this app I was messaging a guy who seemed super chill, he was gonna take me to a concert, and I was like that seems like a lot for a first date but okay I’ll try it. 15 minutes after we agreed to that he sends me a message. “What color panties are you wearing? \"I would love to smell them.” ...Can we get coffee first? The hell of it is, I probably would’ve let him smell my panties. But this is a thing you bring up on the third fuck. You don’t open with panty sniffing. Like the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you’re gonna murder me, and you’re already fucking it up. So this is the experience of women on Tinder. We’re drowning in dick and most of it is terrible. Not all, I do have some very sweet messages, and I haven’t used this app in a couple months, so if I didn’t respond to you or if we didn’t match, it’s not because I rejected you, it\\'s because I don\\'t like the app. People screenshot my profile and post it online, and they call me contrapoints in app, like— I’m just too famous for this shit. My life is hard. So girls, we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad dicks that’s constantly pointed at us on dating apps. But how would you feel if instead of that you were just getting radio silence like the incels get? I can’t speak for other women, but personally, I prefer the firing squad of dicks. You know, at least these pricks care enough about my pussy to be an asshole about my dick. I feel sorry for men on dating apps I really do. They have to deal with a lot of rejection, and that must be difficult. And these apps are especially brutal to people who aren’t photogenic. If you’re meeting people at a bar or a party, you might strike up a conversation with someone you’re not initially physically attracted to. But then maybe they’re super funny, or charming, or maybe they’re attracted to me—and that’s an attractive quality in another person that they appreciate how beautiful I am. But on Tinder, you’re just browsing a catalog of faces, and gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you in the first place. Red-pillers have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of “sexual market value” but like, dating kind of is a marketplace, or at least you can analyze it like one. And our culture is so visual, and these apps are so picture-centered that bone structure, like, it’s not the only thing that matters, but it matters a great deal. And this is where I do have sympathy for the incels, because as a trans woman I know what it’s like to obsess over millimeters of bone. I had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization surgery so that I can going to pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone here and there because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibiteth a brow ridge less pronounced. I mean I’m just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn incels, because I think certain parts of my face make me look like a man, and I worry about it every day. We’re all obsessed with the bones honey. We all have bones inside us, we all love touching bones. [sensual whispering V.O.] You want to take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to the lambdoid suture, and multiply that figure by pi to calculate what we call the Chad circumference. Why is no one talking about the Chad circumference? 4th base: Just the tip There’s another way I think my experience as a trans woman is relevant to the incel discussion, and that’s that I know delusional self-loathing when I see it. I’m far from the first to point out that the “supreme gentleman” incel mass murderer Eliot Rodger was, apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality, an eminently bangable twink. Now I’m not gonna show you pictures of incels, but on their forums they do sometimes post selfie threads. And you can’t say this on incel forums without enraging them, but in confidence from one pretend clinician to another, let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost all of them are completely normal looking guys. But of course that’s not the feedback they get from other incels. The feedback they get is that their chins are weak, their hair is thin, their skin is garbage and there’s no hope whatsoever, no woman will ever love them, they are truecels with no option but to lie down and rot. And the interesting thing is, those guys post selfies to those threads knowing that’s the feedback that they’re gonna get. So why? Why do they do it? Well, I’ll tell you a little story. There is a website on the Internet called 4chan.org that has a board called LGBT. A few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos, but recently it’s used mostly by “men” who are entertaining the notion of becoming women, and by early transition trans women. So the board is jokingly called TTTT. Now I’ve recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition, but the memory is still fresh, and let me tell you, it is a painful, awkward, humiliating stage of life. So the trans women of TTTT are tragic, they’re basically still in man mode, which is why they’re using 4chan, and I bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels. For incels the core frustration is that they can’t get laid. For TTTT it’s that they can’t pass as female. Both groups post selfies knowing they’re going to get brutal unconstructive feedback. And both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their anxieties. For instance on TTTT a major piece of jargon is hon, a slur used by trans women for other trans women, which basically means that you look like a man in a dress, which is what every trans woman is afraid of. And there’s another commonality with incels too, with all bigots and self-loathers, which if you’ve been paying attention, you’ve already guessed. -[V.O] “You will never be seen as a woman because of your head size. \"Have all the surgeries in the world, your massive man noggin will stay the same.” “lel, this freak thinks he has very soft facial features. \"His head is fucking huge, lel and the hons on reddit are hugboxing him and telling him \"that there are women with big heads. \"No, there aren’t. There aren’t fucking women with heads as big as that and ffs won’t change shit. \"You might as well repress. \"You transition with a man’s head. \"You will be clocked, you will be looked at as a freak, you will never be seen as a legit woman. 100%” “THIS is why I am not transitioning. \"Thank you Skull-people for showing me the way and that no matter what I do I will always \"be a manly man skull-wise. \"You saved me the embarrassment of being a literal big-headed man in a dress.\" - \\'Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous and the facial plane wider— - It always comes back to the skulls. Every time. The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot. For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration. Yikes. Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon. If I’m not looked at as a big-skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well, that means that some of their transitions might go well too, and that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness. So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn’t pass, why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me shouldn’t even fucking think about it. They shouldn’t transition at all, they should just repress, they should lie down and rot. And I used to read this stuff all the time. Like I would specifically seek out threads about me. Which might seem strange considering I had hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous goddess every day. So why did I turn away from that to intentionally seek out this dismal den of hons talking about how my giant hon skull is clockable at a thousand paces, and my voice sounds like a ridiculous muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh? Well basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it when people told me I was gorgeous. And for semi-plausible reasons. A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous no matter what they look like. That’s where the word \"hon\" comes from. You look great hon. So what TTTT is saying about reddit hugboxing is true to some extent. There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces. So I came to regard all compliments as “everyone is beautiful,” politically correct cuckoldry. And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT and reading other people saying what my deepest anxieties told me was really true. And that was always painful but there was a kind of pleasure too. There was a rush. It’s exciting to burst out of the politically correct bubble and say what you’re really thinking: that personality doesn’t matter because big-skulled Chads get all the girls, that ContraPoints is a big-skulled hon with a voice like nails on a chalkboard. And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research. I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying, that’s simply my job. But soon I realized it wasn’t just research, and it was infecting me away from the computer. This ridiculous vocabulary—hons, AGP—was popping up in my head at unexpected times. It was really starting to color how I thought about myself, and worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women. And that’s the moment I realized I need to stop looking at this stuff right now or I’m going to become a monster, and once that happens it’s going to be very difficult to fix. This is exactly how the incel blackpill works. There’s something infectious about these vocabularies. Like on the days I’ve been working on this video, I’ll go out at night and these words just involuntarily show up in my thoughts. That bartender is such a Chad, he’s totally height mogging that tiny cuck. And the tragic thing is some incels don’t realize what this is doing to their minds until it’s too late. - [V.O.] “Let’s face it; blackpills are sui fuel, and a lot of us can’t handle them. \"I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it, since I loved uncovering \"secrets that society had been hiding from me, but it has affected my mental health in \"a bad way. \"I made my first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago, and I’ve never needed to \"do that before. \"I could always talk myself out of it through logic, but my mind is ruined now.” - This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm, prototypically teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock-puppet accounts. But the more sophisticated adult version involves intentionally seeking out abusive and disparaging comments about yourself made by other people. I have a long history of doing this, intentionally looking for abusive comments, especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears. Why? I don’t know. Why do people cut themselves? Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology: whatever hurts is true. I’ve recently gotten much better about this. I haven’t been to any of the worst places in a couple months, and my mental health is much improved. So, incels. I’m not going to respond to your worldview like its an intellectual position worthy of rational debate. Because these ideas and arguments, you’re not using them the way rational people use arguments. You’re using them as razor blades to abuse yourselves. And I know because I’ve done the exact same thing. The incel worldview is catastrophizing. It’s an anxious death spiral. And the solution to that has to be therapeutic, not logical. A lot of you are lonely. You’ve been bullied and neglected. You feel left behind by society. But what you’re doing when you\\'re reading incel forums, is you’re slowly internalizing a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves, and at other people in your situation, and at women. And you’re forming mental habits that are going to make it very difficult for you to live a happy life. So what you have to do is get off those forums as fast as possible. I’m going to post a link in the description of this video to instructions on how to block certain websites from your computer, because for me, that’s what it took. 5th base: … anal So the incel reddit/transgender 4chan analogy has a limit, and that limit is that for a significant subset of the incel community, the primary hatred is not directed at themselves, but at women. And they really hate women. Like I’m basically a professional internet bigotry scholar at this point, I look at this kind of stuff all the time, but researching this video I was honestly kind of shocked by the intensity of misogyny on incel forums. I won’t show the worst of it but we’re talking blaming women for rape, saying they deserve to be raped, calls for state-mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but most of all just a kind of generalized misinformed rage. -[V.O.] “I hate women. \"I really do. \"Every time I look at them, my blood pressure shoots through the roof. \"When they\\'re gabbing on the cell phone about Paris Hilton. \"When they’re adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time rifling through their stupid purse. \"When they whine to me about their period. \"When they blither on and on about some artist/film director/musician nobody gives a flipping fuck about. \"When they cry and expect your personal sympathy. \"But most of all I hate them because they’re smug hyperactive little bitches made that \"way by our shithole society. \"Look what uncontrolled feminism and the media has done— - Hi Stacy, it’s Tracy. Well I was at the mall with Amber, Heather, Jenna, and Trish and we were talking about Paris Hilton, a very relevant cultural figure in 2018. They live in this cartoon caricature world where it’s easy to avoid thinking of women as fully human. And that’s where my sympathy runs dry. Because this kind of hatred just needs a spark to turn to violence. So incels, I know you’re not gonna listen to anything I say, and you’re just gonna say I’m a tranny and faggot and a degenerate, and to that I say how dare you say things that are entirely true. But also: volcel if you wouldn’t bitches. And I know you don’t listen to suggestions about you could probably actually have healthy relationships. So no one can really reach you until you get out of those forums and allow yourselves to be reached. But by way of a closing remark I guess I simply invite you to consider that you don’t even need a warm body or a sex robot to satisfy the erotic longing. You know when I was your age in 1975 every teenage boy had a stratocaster in his bedroom [shredding] that was the outlet for his sexual frustration. What I’m suggesting is the manosphere exists because rock n roll is dead. But there’s other options. Think about eroticism of a rainstorm, the clap of thunder, the rustle of the leaves, the steam rising off the warm pavement [sniff]. And whether you’re a Chad, a Stacy, an incel, or a hon, you can always return to the caress of our dark mother, the sea, whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body.

[Mendelssohn, \"A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream Overture, Allegro di molto\"] There\\'s a lot of people talking lately about \"the West\" and \"Western culture\" and \"Western civilization\" But what do those words even mean?

She will destroy her enemies and raze their castles to the ground. The song \"Let It Go\" is basically, \"Fuck this shit. I\\'m conquering everyone.\\'\" - So, just to be clear this- this is a grown man who has dressed himself in the garb of a sorcerer to shout about a YouTube channel for preschoolers. It almost feels like punching down at this point. At least the Golden One was masc4masc. Who can I punch up at? Blegh. I don\\'t like talking about punching. It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching TERFs. I would never a punch a TERF. [shimmering noises] My hands are too feminine and my fingers are tired. Someone massage them.

I argued that \"pomo nomo\" is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas None of which are in any sense non-Western. Unless of course you equate the West with white people and Marxism with the Jews, which, surely no one involved in this conversation is doing, riiight? [failure sound effect] [whispering] I\\'m guessing he wasn\\'t a fan of the bath scene.

So I suppose we should probably figure out what that\\'s supposed to mean. Which is too bad because that\\'s gonna require a lot of thinking, and I don\\'t feel like thinking because my brain is tired. Someone massage it. And soon, mechanically, dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the corndog. No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate, then a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory - This new sensation having had on me the effect which a love has, of - [sudden] post-preambulatory banter. Whether you\\'re in fashy YouTube, or pomo nomo acadomono, It\\'s common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous, clearly defined thing called \"Western civilization\" that starts in ancient Athens and flourishes in our own era of enlightened philosopher kings. Announcer: [screaming] \"Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\" But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively by modern people for particular purposes. It\\'s like an origin myth. In an article titled, \"There is no such thing as Western civilization,\" the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, there was no such thing as \"the West.\" The world was divided into three continents he called Europe, Asia, and Libya. Herodotus had no notion that these three continents corresponded to different types of people, and he never referred to any group of people called \"European.\" In fact, he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia, in which he traveled, than with the faraway and foreign people of Northern Europe. So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that. Really there is no one idea of \"the West,\" which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas. According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked under the heading of \"the West.\" Let\\'s talk about them now. Concept 1: Christendom and \"Judeo-Christian Values\" In the year 732, a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory at the Battle of Tours against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain into what is now France effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate into Western Europe. According to Appiah, the first recorded use of the Latin term \\'Europenses\\' or Europeans dates from 754, and describes the victors of the Battle of Tours distinguishing Christians from Muslims. In the late Middle Ages, the concept of Christendom appeared, and was used to distinguish the Christian world from the Islamic world and from paganism. This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor to the modern concept of the West. Notice that the term itself posits an us-versus-them dichotomy, where Christians are the \\'us\\' and Muslims are the \\'them.\\' The Christian inheritance is still invoked today by defenders of the West like Lil\\' Benny and Professor Studied-the-Blade, often under the heading of [The Hallelujah chorus of Handel\\'s Messiah plays] \"Judeo-Christian Values\" a term usually used to falsely imply that contemporary moral norms derived from such a generic, parochial, and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments, as if every major civilization didn\\'t have laws against murder, as if the prohibition of graven images has any contemporary influence whatsoever, as if it isn\\'t an embarrassment that there are four laws protecting snowflake Yahweh\\'s easily-triggered ego, and none condemning slavery and rape. And what if I LIKE it when my neighbor covets my ass?? Bible jokes! The other main use of \"Judeo-Christian values\" is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers. Speaking of which, what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom? Two kids and a dog, just like the Bible says? Well, no. Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament and not forbidden in either Testament. Even in the beginning, Eve couldn\\'t keep her hands away from strange serpents (and who can blame her) and Joseph was a massive cuck who raised another man\\'s child. But it\\'s cool, he was into that. In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church gradually enforced the one-man-and-one-woman view of marriage, although in formerly pagan lands, this idea was slow to take hold. Charles Martel\\'s grandson Charlemagne had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines, because he was a proud son of the North, 100% natty and Alpha as fuck. I\\'m sorry. I - I just can\\'t stop. The Golden One... his soul and mine are intermingled, probably because we both played twelve hundred hours of Age of Empires in 1999, and then something went terribly wrong: Fuckin\\' 9/11. It used to be such an innocent decision, choosing to play as the Franks or the Saracens, then it became this huge civilizational struggle, and that\\'s why this guy is a fascist and I grew up to be a woman. Thanks a lot, Osama. Being transgender is so weird. Like, you have these childhood memories that are just totally discordant with your adult gender identity. Like, how do you even deal with that? Well, here\\'s how: you bond with straight guys over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia, and then you fuck them. I\\'M NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS Wololo [a distorted version of \"FLORAL SHOPPE\" plays: Concept 2: Enlightenment Values So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior named Martin Luther nails his list of whiney complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg. That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence between Catholics and Protestants. That eventually chills out, but then the 18th century rolls around and shit\\'s just fucking crazy. There are various fops and dandies and macaronis getting wired out of their heads at coffee houses and babbling about enlightenment like the beatnik trash they are. Then 300 years later, a bunch of drink-sodden fedora tippers appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire, before sinking into sweeping sexual harassment allegations under the rug and making fifty-five consecutive YouTube videos about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games. That\\'s not what they were discussing at the Parisian salon. This is all very embarrassing, but still, some of these enlightenment values — science, liberty, skepticism about dogma — these are basically good ideas, and they\\'re part of the amalgamation we call \"the West,\" but it\\'s important to keep in mind that these ideas are not \"Judeo-Christian\". In fact, they\\'re specifically opposed to that way of thinking. So the sum of what we now think of as \"the West\" actually contains major contradictions, because the history of the West is a history of change and revolution. So when a new movement comes along, like, for instance, a bunch of buzzkill sad sacks pointing out that actually, our society is still pretty terrible to women, people of color, and gender and sexual minorities it might not be the smartest thing to just dismiss it as some kind of sinister postmodern neo-Marxist cuckoldry. It could be the next reformation in a history marked by a series of reformations. If there are any historians watching this, please call it the SJW Reformation. Think about the Protestant Reformation. At the time, that probably seemed like a civilizational threat to the Holy Roman Empire, and it kind of was. But in retrospect, we see the Reformation as just as important a moment in Western culture as the medieval period that preceded it. But today\\'s counter-reformation, made up of people like Orangie Smalls and Dr. Clean-Your-Room (ummm) insist on pretending the current reformation is some kind of alien threat. And as for the counter-counter-reformation, well, that\\'s what you pay a trashy tran to do. Concept 3: Western Culture The idea of \"the West\" has its roots in the medieval schism between the Western Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. But in its contemporary sense, the idea of \"Western culture\" didn\\'t really exist until the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spengler\\'s 1918 book, \\'The Decline of the West\\', an important influence on Nazi ideology. As long as people have been talking about \"Western culture\", they\\'ve been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration as I\\'ve discussed in several earlier videos which I encourage you not to watch. But the idea of Western culture was influential well beyond the Third Reich. At the height of European imperialism, the idea of a superior high culture of the West was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit the mysterious Orient. And even though we\\'ve swept the more overtly supremacist rhetoric under the rug, the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept in our schools and universities where you have to take courses like History of Western Civilization or Western Literature that you didn\\'t actually do any of the readings for because you were too busy crouching in the bushes outside the Dean\\'s office vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu. The consequence of this Western culture education is that we now all have this sense that we belong to a continuous civilization whose crowning achievements are the Ten Commandments, Jesus-fuckin\\'-Christ, Athenian pederasts, cathedrals, Mozart, human rights, science, and iPhones. But the reality is, this is an essentialist conglomeration of a history that\\'s much more nonlinear than we often think. We in the West claim to be the inheritors of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham, but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim. St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers, is largely responsible for introducing Aristotle to Christian universities but he never would have encountered Aristotle in the first place had not ancient Greek philosophy been translated and commentated by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd. So the origins of Western culture aren\\'t really unique to us at all. And the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions. On the one hand you have Judeo-Christian values, and on the other hand you have degenerates like William Shakespeare who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens and make out with each other. [shimmer noises] Which, for the record, is disgusting, and I condemn it, and I\\'ll have no part in it. Cause if you didn\\'t know, in Shakespeare times, boys in drag played female parts. I wish I had female parts. Working on it. Concept 4: The Free World From 1941 to 1945, Franklin Roosevelt\\'s Vice President was Henry Wallace, an agricultural scientist from Iowa whom Democratic Party officials despised for being what we\\'d now call a Democratic Socialist. Wallace later ran for president in 1948 as a third party candidate on a platform of universal health care, anti-segregation, and opposition to the Cold War. During the campaign, Wallace was widely mocked in the press for his spiritualism, his refusal to disavow the Communist Party\\'s endorsement, and what TIME Magazine called \"his assault on the south,\" that is, his quote \"ostentatious ride through cities and towns with his Negro secretary beside him\", for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs. The poor, naive Wallace commented, \"There is something so unlovely about hate when you see it distorting the human face.\" Well, get used to it buddy. This is America. Am I lecturing someone from 1948 about how bigoted this country is? This is fine. Wallace received only 2.4 percent of the popular vote in the 1948 election and he\\'s now best remembered for his 1942 speech titled, \"The Century of the Common Man\", in which he contrasted what he called the \"slave world\" of fascists with the free world, which he described as an incomplete and ongoing international People\\'s Revolution. - [Narrator] \"No Nazi counter-revolution will stop it; \"the common man will smoke the Hitler stooges out into the open in the United States, in Latin America, and in India. \"He will destroy their influence. No Lavals, no Mussolinis, will be tolerated in a free world.\" - Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it, but it was common during World War II, when the phrase \"the free world\" first entered common parlance, to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers, including the dirty Reds. After the war, the phrase \"The Free World\" remained common in American politics. But the meaning shifted. Instead of referring to the international alliance against fascism, it referred to the capitalist West, as opposed to the communist East. The idea of the free Capitalist West is still an important ingredient in this jumbled concept we call Western civilization. So when Lobster Dad says there\\'s a struggle between Marxism and the West, it seems at first like he\\'s just stuck in the 1980s or something. Doesn\\'t he know there\\'s no more Eastern Bloc? Dad? What year do you think it is? Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies? [whispering] They\\'re on your side now, remember? The truth is, he\\'s just using the term Neo-Marxism to invoke Red Scare sentiment in opposition to the SJW Reformation. But the point I\\'m trying to make is that the West is a concept, or rather several contradictory concepts, that are always posited in particular political circumstances as one side of an us-versus-them opposition. Whether it\\'s the Christian West versus the infidels, the Enlightenment West versus Islam, the cultured West versus the colonized savages, the capitalist West versus the communist East, or the white European West versus the Jewish Cultural Marxist plot to cuck the sons of the North by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens and inundating their countries with a barbarous horde of Third World migrants. I guess I have to say something about that, huh. Concept 5: Blood and Soil If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer Richard Spencer what he thinks the West is, he\\'ll tell you that it\\'s a cultural, geographic, and genetic inheritance bequeathed to European people by their fair-skinned ancestors. To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent could be part of the West is ridiculous, because for Spencer, to be Western is to be white. Now the thing about that is, as an analysis of the common usage of the term \"the West,\" it\\'s not even wrong. Consider Latin America, where the main languages spoken are Spanish, Portuguese, and French, where the majority religion is Roman Catholicism. Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the West? Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders? Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club. Or, to be more accurate, the flexible and historically variant concepts of whiteness and the West have been constructed so as to exclude them. And I\\'ve already spent half my YouTube career on delirious gay screeching about Nazis so I don\\'t want to do more of that now. But suffice to say, the association between whiteness and the West is always lurking beneath the surface and when whiteness rears its head proudly, the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of. As I\\'m making this video, the machinery of the middle stages of those crimes is up and running yet again, thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe and a racist demagogue in the United States. And once more both continents are dotted with barbed wire, refugee ghettos, and internment camps full of children torn from parents. Concept 6: The Evil West \"The West\" in many ways is an inherently supremacist concept. It\\'s thought to be more civilized, more holy, and more cultured than the non-West. But there are some ridiculous college professors who adopt this story wholesale, but flip it on its head. According to them, the West is not uniquely civilized, but uniquely uncivilized, cruel, imperialistic, racist, and genocidal. But this just perpetuates the same essentializing error. Europeans aren\\'t inherently more evil any more than they\\'re inherently more civilized. If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa 400 years ago, the result would have been just as brutal. So instead of vilifying the West, I think we should get rid of the concept altogether, adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves, and acknowledge that the world is too complicated to reduce to simple us-and-them binaries. Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle and classical music and the Cheesecake Factory. We can still keep all that shit while eliminating the propaganda and injustice that surrounds it. Coda My mind is a predator that preys upon itself. WHAT IF TRAPS ARE GAY WHAT IF NO ONE CAN EVER LOVE YOU WHAT IF HAPPINESS IS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT IF EVERYONE WHO COMPLIMENTS ME IS LYING SO THEY CAN LAUGH AT ME LATER WHEN I DELUSIONALLY FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF - WHAT IF WHEN YOU DIE YOU STAY CONSCIOUS AND THEN YOU JUST ARE - WHAT IF I\\'M STANDING IN AN AWKWARD WAY AND IT LOOKS WEIRD WHAT IF BLANCHARD IS RIGHT WHAT ARE THESE HORRIBLE GODDAMN NOISES COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain and music is really great for that. I\\'ve always liked classical music. When I listen to Mozart or Mendelssohn or even an amateur like Satie, my mind is lifted to a higher plateau and I don\\'t care what civilization the composer came from or whether he was a bigot or a sexist, and I don\\'t want to know because I NEED this. I need this feeling that makes me just want to take a big [bleep] inside of my balls [bleeeeeep] And I can fit two at once!

But I\\'m not just a pretty face. I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social & political issues. Even though I\\'m trans, I refuse to be a victim, because I prefer to take control of my own life. Which is why I support our president, [SNAPS FINGERS] Donald J. Trump. Make traps gay again. [SASSY BELL NOISE] Byeeee! [GLASS SHATTERING] ♪♪ - Hi. I\\'m Jackie Jackson, host of The Freedom Report, where— I\\'m sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese drag queen redecorated an Italian bordello? It\\'s— It\\'s hard to move past it. Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political spectrum. But I\\'ve brought them here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate about a timeless question: Are traps gay? My first guest is Adria Finley, host of a popular YouTube series, Intersectional AF. Clarence? - Hey YouTube, it\\'s ya girl, Adria. Have you ever considered that transphobia... is racist? - Okay. My other guest is, returning to the show, it\\'s Tiffany Tumbles. Now, Tiffany, you\\'ve had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program. Isn\\'t that right? That\\'s right, Jackie. It\\'s pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW. You poor thing! Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill? - Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders, and how I was tired of trendy teens who don\\'t experience dysphoria calling themselves trans, and next thing I know, everyone\\'s calling me a TERF and a traitor. So I said, you know what, I\\'m out. I\\'m not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame. I think it\\'s just so brave of you. - Yeah, wow. So brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are. - Shut up, Adria! I had just come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that, the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support. Nothing. I was absolutely alone. Do you have any idea what that felt like? Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria. One wrong move and you\\'re dead to them. Those are not friends. - Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany. I think you\\'re gonna fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left, and speaking out against politically correct dogma. Why don\\'t we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany\\'s newest videos? - So I\\'m gonna go in with the highlighter, pop it on my cheeks. Pop it on my brow, till I\\'m literally blinding. I am glowing! Hmm. She\\'s doing alright, but I\\'m not living for it. You know what else I\\'m not living for? The Muslims. Tiffany, you are so funny! - I\\'m sorry. Are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism? - How is that racist? Muslim\\'s a religion, not a race. - Yeah, Adria! Muslim\\'s a religion, not a race. - Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together. You can\\'t just... Well, you both know exactly what I\\'m talking about. - Let\\'s try to get back on track here. So, Adria: Traps. Are they gay? - Look, there\\'s so many things wrong with the question that the only way to answer is to deconstruct it. First of all, what are traps? Are they trans women? Because if you\\'re calling trans women traps, then you\\'re directly playing into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men; a lie that reinforces the mentality that causes men to murder us. - Well, I don\\'t think \"trap\" is necessarily a trans woman. What about anime? - Okay, so the word \"trap\" was invented by English-speaking anime fans. The Japanese word is otokonoko (男の娘), which just means a male crossdresser. There\\'s no implication of tricking men. But the word \"trap\" is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women. So when you tell us that\\'s not what it means, you\\'re gaslighting the shit out of us, because we\\'ve all heard it used as a slur. - Adria, you don\\'t get to speak for all trans women. We\\'re not all offended all the time. I actually happen to identify as a trap. - Yeah, Adria. She identifies as a trap. - Well, she\\'s in the sunken place. And Tiffany, that\\'s pretty reckless. Doesn\\'t it bother you at all that if some guy murders you, his defense is gonna be, \"Well, she was a trap, I was tricked,\" and you\\'ll have contributed to that way of thinking? - What do you care, Adria? No one\\'s gonna be trapped by you anyway! - Ooh, spicy. - The fuck did you just say? - I said, no shade, but you don\\'t really look like a woman. - Jackie, are you going to allow your guest to talk to me like this? - Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer. - Look, dragging bitches is what I do. Facts over feels, honty. - Well, Adria, don\\'t you think she has a bit of a point? Like, if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in. I mean, what is this, a men\\'s shirt? How are you gonna attract men with that? - I\\'m not trying to attract men. I\\'m a lesbian. - I\\'m sorry. Maybe this is a stupid question, but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian? - Well, I\\'m a woman and I like women. - I dunno about that. Sounds debatable. - I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the transphobia special! - Transphobia? Well, Adria, I think that\\'s very unfair. I mean, I\\'ve invited two trans women to be on my program, and I\\'ll have you know that one of my best friends happens to be a gay man. And what could be transphobic about that? - See, Adria, you\\'re the reason why everyone hates trans people. You\\'re obnoxious and offended by everything, and everyone feels like they have to tread on eggshells around you. - Thank you, Tiffany. See, you\\'re one of the good ones. You\\'re a good tran. - Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany? Be the lapdog of people like this? - No. I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people by being patient and agreeable, and by looking the part, and not by screeching \"transphobia\" at everyone who doesn\\'t meet your impossible standard of wokeness. - And you\\'re gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh? Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away? - Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany, that you\\'re not gaining acceptance for anyone but yourself? And the only reason you\\'re accepted is that you don\\'t challenge the status quo? - I\\'m sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas, because I feel like we\\'re just getting hung up on terminology. Look, Adria, if you don\\'t like the word \"trap\", we just won\\'t use the word \"trap\". The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to trans women? - It is if you\\'re a woman. - No, I mean for men. Like... Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men? - Well, all the men I\\'ve dated only date women, but if they\\'re attracted to me... I mean, it\\'s not the straightest thing, is it? - Why not? You look like a woman, and I know that you know that gay men are not attracted to these tits. - Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so, granted. - But doesn\\'t she have a point, though, Adria? I mean, sure, she looks like a woman, but she does have XY chromosomes. - When was the last time you were attracted to a person\\'s chromosomes? That\\'s not how sexuality works. We\\'re attracted to a person\\'s perceptible features, not molecular biology. - Okay, sure, but... I mean, a lot of trans women still have their penis, and you got to admit, that seems kinda gay. - Jackie, you really have no clue what you\\'re doing, do you? We live in a world where there\\'s no shortage of men who want to date trans women, but there\\'s an intense stigma on dating trans women. And it\\'s actually dangerous, because what happens is, if a man\\'s friends find out that the woman he\\'s dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by lashing out violently against the trans woman he\\'s dating. And this happens again and again, and every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay, you\\'re adding to that stigma, and you\\'re making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women. - Alright, I\\'m not trying to use violent words or whatever. I just don\\'t understand how a person who\\'s attracted to women could be attracted to a person with a penis. - Well, if you want to know, I\\'ll tell you. I am a lesbian. I\\'m only attracted to women, including trans women. And when I\\'m attracted to a trans woman, I perceive her as a woman. And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation, but as a part of her female body. So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick. - I\\'m sorry, what? What is girl dick? - The feminine penis. - Oh, no... - Oh, come on, this is nonsense! How could a penis possibly be feminine? - Well, it\\'s feminine because it\\'s on a woman, but also because hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis. - [EXASPERATED SIGH] Shut up, Adria. Just shut up! - Wait, really? How is it different? - Well, I\\'m glad you asked. More needs to be said about the feminine penis. Why is no one talking about the feminine penis? - Kill me now. - So, to start with, it doesn\\'t get as hard, it doesn\\'t really ejaculate, and it has a different mouthfeel. - Ugh. - Can we please talk about the mouthfeel? Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel? - [GROANING] - I don\\'t think that\\'s necessary. I\\'m just trying to wrap my head around this. You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men? - That\\'s correct. I don\\'t like man dick. It\\'s coarse and rough and irritating, and it cums everywhere. Not like girl dick. Girl dick is everything soft and smooth. - Ugh. - What is that, Star Wars? Ugh! Do you also build computers for a living? - I mean, guilty. I also enjoy wearing knee socks. [SICK GUITAR RIFF] - And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist catgirl. - My sweet love. - Wait, you\\'re dating that crazy Antifa cat? - Well, we\\'re in the same polycule. - I don\\'t know what that means. And I\\'m not, like, prejudiced or anything, but I\\'m just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism. Like, if you\\'re born male, and you\\'re attracted to women, how is it not just heterosexuality? - Well, my girlfriend is also trans, so if you follow your logic to its conclusion... - Okay, so... You\\'re a woman who was born a man, and you like women, but you\\'re dating a woman... ...a woman who has a penis, that\\'s a female penis, that used to be a male penis... - [DEEP THOUGHTS OVERLAPPING] [DEEP THOUGHTS CONTINUE] ...So that means you are gay, but you\\'re gay in the opposite way as the kind of gay that you were born as? - I can go over it with you again after the show, if you need some extra time to figure it out. [V.O.] Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals? - Adria, just stop talking. Look, I don\\'t care what you do in private, but I\\'m sorry to break it to you. The world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism. What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile, and people like me to be our representatives. Because I act like a normal woman, and I date normal men, and I don\\'t have a catgirl girlfriend with a girl dick. Ugh! Also, I look fucking gorgeous. I\\'m sorry, but that matters. - Well, you look just fine, but let\\'s not get arrogant, sweetheart. You\\'re not Blaire White. - Well, I haven\\'t saved the money to have work done, so that\\'s not a fair comparison. - What work are you having done? - I\\'m gonna lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw, reshape my brow, get some lip injections, maybe Botox my forehead. Oh, and I\\'m gonna fix my nose, obviously. - What\\'s wrong with your nose? - It\\'s kind of big and mannish. - Well, my nose looks kind of like that. Are you saying I look mannish? Are you saying I look ugly? What are you trying to say, Tiffany? Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to women? - I\\'m not doing anything to wome— Wh-What? - Look, we can\\'t all become hairless sex dolls. - That\\'s a terrible thing to say to a trans woman. She has to work really hard to be seen as female, and you just don\\'t. - Shut the hell up, Adria! Don\\'t get offended for me! Don\\'t condescend to me! I\\'m not a victim! - Okay, so I\\'m not as young as I used to be. [SOBBING] But my fiancee still thinks I\\'m beautiful! [V.O.] Oh my God, I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this. [JACKIE SOBBING] All right, let\\'s— Let\\'s forget about it. I\\'m, I\\'m, I\\'m— I\\'m, I\\'m— I\\'m fine! - Tiffany, are you fine? - I\\'m fine. - To be clear, I\\'m not fine with any of this. - Look, why don\\'t we just edit this whole thing out? Let\\'s shoot the closer, and we\\'ll fix it in post. Well, we may never know whether traps are gay, but the important thing is that we talked about it. I\\'m Jackie Jackson for The Freedom Report, where the debate never stops. - Your mascara is running. - Get out of my studio, both— both of you! Get out! We\\'re done. - [SIGHS] - [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] - Hi, Nick. Yeah, I\\'m finished. Well, it was a shitshow. No, Adria was fine. She was cringe as fuck the whole time. Let\\'s have her back. Tiffany was the problem. She kept veering off message, and she got emotional. Yeah, don\\'t invite her back. Get Blaire next time. And the week after... can we get Kanye West? We can\\'t get Kanye. Get Candace Owens. Oh, and what have you done to my studio? - Hey, Adria, look... I\\'m— I\\'m sorry I was rude to you back there, okay? It\\'s just that I\\'ve been working so hard to win acceptance for trans people, to show everyone that we\\'re normal, we\\'re just like them. And... When you show up looking like that and acting like that, it\\'s— it\\'s just hard for me to watch all my hard work be undone, you know? Like, you can\\'t be talking about this— the \"feminine penis\" in front of cis people. - Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now for your own physical safety. - Ugh! Oh my God, you crazy freak! I hate Adria. She looks like a man-beast! Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions. Ugh, this hon! People are gonna see this, and they\\'re gonna think this is what trans people are! They should not be representing us. They\\'re nothing like me. I\\'m nothing like them! I need to relax. Well, it\\'s up. I look good. But Adria\\'s fucking everything up! Alright, what are they saying? Oh, fuck it. Ooh... [SNAPPING FINGERS] Okay! So I don\\'t pass perfectly. But at least I know that. I may have a mental illness, but I\\'m— I\\'m self-aware about it! I\\'m not delusional! I\\'m not like Adria! I\\'m nothing like her! Y\\'know, it\\'s— it\\'s fine. It\\'s... it\\'s gonna be fine.

Ugh, Foppington, are we doing this again? Lady Foppington. I’m so happy to finally meet the real you. Enchanté. I’m not gonna kiss your hand you freak, I’m more of a woman than you are. That’s not what they were saying at the Parisian salon. Clock me Amadeus. Don’t break the fourth wall. I’m trying to make a video about postmodernism. Get out of my drawing room you 18th century sexual deviant. So much for the tolerant Jacobins. Hm! Reason. Power. Truth. These are the kinds of topics that I simply don’t care about. Unfortunately we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson. So who’s Jordan Peterson? [Sigh] Well, he’s a psychology professor at the University of Toronto who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law shall surely lead to Stalinism. Since then he’s been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer. David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the Western world, and his self-help book 12 Rules for Life is a national and international bestseller. I’m starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously. He’s got a ton of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here watching this video because I wanna talk. A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson haven’t really engaged with his ideas very much, he’s often caricatured, avoided, or talked past, as in the infamous BBC interview where Cathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says. So you’re saying that by and large women are too agreeable to get the pay raises they deserve? No, I’m saying that’s one component— You’re saying that women aren’t intelligent enough to run these top companies? No— You’re just saying these things though to provoke, aren’t you? I mean you are a provocateur. You’re like the Alt Right that you hate to be compared to. You’re saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters. I think to people watching this it comes off as if leftists are like, afraid of his actual ideas. But I’m not afraid of his ideas. I’m not afraid of anything. I just smoked a bunch of fuckin PCP. [heavy breathing] Daddy. So I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson’s lectures and podcasts and reading his books, and honestly I think I get why people like him. Clearly he has real talent as a public speaker and as a kind of life coach. His book 12 Rules for Life echoes past bestsellers like Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People or Rick Warren’s The Purpose-Driven Life. The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like “take responsibility for yourself” and “don’t envy other people,” and he renews them with the intellectual trappings of psychology, philosophy, Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings. He’s telling us a pretty classic story: life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering, so you need a higher purpose in your life. But I knew that already. I learned it at the AA meetings I refuse to go to. These are like basic insights of world philosophy and religion. But they’re insights that today’s youthssss apparently haven’t heard before, I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics. Or at any rate they haven’t heard them in a vocabulary that they connected with, so to a lot of people Peterson’s ideas seem new and urgent. And I don’t really object to any of this self-help stuff. Most of Peterson’s fans are young men, and I mean someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape, and if Peterson can do that, more power to him. I mean sometimes boys just need a daddy. And sometimes girls do too. But there’s a big problem here. And the problem is that all this life coaching is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda. Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help not merely as a guide to private life, but as a replacement for progressive politics, which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil. There’s no comparison between Mao and a trans activist is there? Why not? The philosophy that’s guiding their utterances is the same philosophy. Now Peterson doesn’t use the word progressive politics because that doesn’t sound scary enough. His new, scarier word is Postmodern neo-Marxism. Now we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neo-Marxism with Cultural Marxism the Nazi conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West. Surely this is not the same thing as that, right? Right? So look: I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist. And you may quote me on that. But I’m wondering, if it’s not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West, then what is postmodern neo-Marxism? Well JP, that’s what I’d like to talk about. So Jordan—sorry, Dr. Peterson, Professor, Daddy—Let’s talk. And for once I’d like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect I think it deserves— [Sultry sax music] Mm, that’s good, it’s a good temperature. Hand me the oil, would you daddy? [beeps and boops] Thanks Daddy. It’s really an honor to bathe with a public intellectual of your… stature. [beeps and boops] You know, I never like to argue in the bath, so I want to start by telling you the things I like about you. The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the Left—the stifling of even slightly different opinions, the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments, the politics of resentment—are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints. I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person, oh god the dysphoria, please don’t watch it. But my worry is that you’re leading an international political backlash against what is a very localized problem, and I worry that some of our society’s most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash. Like fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly-sensitive student activists, but if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights, that would be bad right? [beeps and boops] I also like that you tell people how to live their lives. I mean I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom but clearly the sheep need a shepherd, and you’ve really stepped up with these twelve rules. You know on the left we don’t really tell people what to do. We tell them what not to do. Don’t exploit the workers, do not do blackface. I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people, but that’s a pretty small rule compared to some of your rules like how to raise your children or when it’s okay to criticize things. [beeps and boops] The last thing I like is that you talk about deep shit. I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons were talking about Plato and Aristotle and the meaning of life and I thought huh, on the Left we don’t really talk about that kind of thing, all we talk about is how society oppresses people. And that might not be enough, because people need to have a positive purpose in life. I mean personally I don’t give a shit, I’m pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons of Strangers With Candy until I die. But other people like Dostoyevsky, Camus, other white guys who talk about lobsters, they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering, and like not just complain about patriarchy. I guess it’s easier not to complain about patriarchy when patriarchy isn’t the thing that’s making you suffer. But I do think an education that only teaches people about oppression is inadequate. We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad, and then we say, well you’re educated now, good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye! And that really kind of sucks. But you know I think that’s a point that could probably be made without comparing transgender activism to Stalin. [beeps and boops] I feel like this has come across a little more sarcastic than I intended. See this is why you’ve got to use a firmer hand with me Peterson. If you don’t establish dominance I’m just gonna mouth off. They use all this compassion language, and I’m on the side of the oppressed, all of that posturing. It does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power. And I’ve just been starting to review their curriculum for children from kindergarten to grade eight. It’s pure social justice postmodernism. The people who hold this doctrine, this radical postmodern communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount, they’ve got control of most low to mid-level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well, but even in the United States where— [Sultry sax music] [Summer crickets] So you gotta give it to JP, when he says “stand up straight with your shoulders back” he means it. So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences with fairly popular opinions: political correctness often feels stifling; student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive; angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use and I don’t like it. But once he draws you in with these inviting preludes, he leads you to a pretty weird place. His central political message is that leftist professors, student activists, campus diversity initiatives, and corporate HR departments are collectively following the philosophy of postmodern neo-Marxism to destroy Western civilization and sink us all into a totalitarian nightmare. Now there’s just no avoiding that this idea is actually pretty similar to the cultural Marxism or cultural Bolshevism theory, but I’m just going to ignore that because if I dwell on it I’ll sound like I’m saying Peterson is a fascist and then everyone will think I’m crazy. Look I’m not afraid of psychologists… I have nothing to hide. So let’s just try not to think about that and instead just straightforwardly ask, is it true that postmodern neo-Marxism is out to destroy us all? Well, why don’t we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism? We all know what Marxism is, the idea that society should be understood as a class struggle between workers and capitalists, and that the workers will eventually revolt. Some college professors definitely do believe that, but 0% of corporate HR departments do, so... that… okay… So what is postmodernism? Well, it’s the vaguest word in the English language. Some people try to explain it by listing all the things that are called postmodern and then trying to guess what they have in common. That’s basically what the YouTuber ArmouredSkeptic did in his video about it. So many daddies in this video. We should invite them all to a barbecue, complain about postmodernism, listen to some Zeppelin. I’ve had worse evenings. I don’t really think there is a common thread linking all the things called postmodern. Basically postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945 that seemed new at the time. But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism he’s not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino. He’s talking about postmodern philosophy. So what’s that? Well [sigh] basically it’s a kind of skepticism. Not YouTube skepticism, but actual skepticism, you know like having doubts about whether humans can really know things about the world. Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea, that goes way back to ancient times (mmm) but more specifically postmodernism is skepticism about modernism. So what’s modernism? What’s what? What are words? What’s anything? I’m gonna divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it. First there’s early modernism. Early modernism is the philosophy developed by a bunch of boring 18th century queens which says that we can form universal theories about the world through observation and reasoning AKA the scientific method. Now that turns out to work pretty well for whatever questions you have about plants and crystals and how to medically reconfigure human genitals but it has some limits, which was pointed out by David Hume, one of the least boring 18th century queens and one of the only philosophers I can actually put up with in small doses even though he was a fucking racist and also Scottish. THIS IS A CALL OUT. Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective you can’t really know much about important things like morality, causation, and the self, because those aren’t the kinds of things you can observe. Anyway then the late modernists came along and they said fuck Hume we’re gonna do science about those things anyway. So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards who one way or another tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans. So for example you have psychoanalysis which said human nature can be understood in terms of unconscious drives, which is of course ridiculous, I’m conscious of all my drives. And you got Marxism with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat, you got early sociology and anthropology which started out with racist social evolutionism and progressed to a kind of we’re-all-the-same universalism. Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists. His first book Maps of Meaning is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world and create order out of chaos through universal myths and archetypes, which he claims are a product of our species’ evolutionary past. Boy this is a lot of explaining. It’s so much explaining it’s triggering my gender dysphoria. I’d better put on some longer nails. Nails? Is that all womanhood means to you? … mhmm! Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism. So whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories about reality, history, and humanity, postmodernists say actually no, that’s not possible. For example the French postmodernist Michel “Faux-coo” Sargon! You little goose! Michel “Faux-coo” wrote intellectual histories of subjects like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice in which he argued that we should not understand these histories as straightforward progressions toward liberty and scientific truth but rather as mere shifts in the way that power orders our institutions and populations. The other postmodernist I’ve actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty (yeah fuck you Derrida, if you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read). Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls “ironism,” irony being the skeptical caution with which we should regard our own beliefs in our awareness that our vocabulary for describing and understanding the world is not the final or best vocabulary. Alright, that’s enough explaining. And my nails are done, check it out! Do you enjoy having long glamorous nails, but do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them with barely concealed visceral rage? Well I have a solution for you! The bisexual manicure! One hand for the V. One hand for the D. Both for degeneracy! It’s absolutely filthy! So we’ve got all the pieces on the table, now we just need to put the puzzle together. On the one hand we have Marxism, a fundamentally modernist worldview that theorizes the human condition in economic terms. On the other hand we have postmodernism, a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity to know any universal truths about anything. On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas are not compatible. And there is an extensive history of dispute between them, with for instance the Marxist Sartre calling Foucault “the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.” And of course as we all know, when Foucault died capitalism did end forever. [Internationale] So where does Peterson get off talking about “postmodern neo-Marxism.” Well, it’s true that a lot of postmodernists were in some way influenced by Marxism, so the phrase could just refer to that continuity. But that’s not what Peterson means. It’s clear from the way he uses the term that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical than it initially appears. Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to include not only postmodern intellectuals and Marxist intellectuals, but also liberal politicians, academic administrators and corporate HR departments that care about diversity, and so-called identity politics activists, including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists. Basically it’s the entirety of the modern left. Now I’ve already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism are fundamentally at odds, since Marxism is a big story about a struggle between two clear and distinct groups, and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this and about the stability of binaries like bourgeoisie and proletariat. But that’s not the only tension in Peterson’s clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism. Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows that Marxists and identity politics activists are constantly at each others’ throats, because the Marxists accuse the activists of being bourgeois dogs who want more female CEOs of color and more disabled transgender drone pilots, while the activists accuse the Marxists of being a boys club of brocialists no more woke on gender and race issues than the average Jordan Peterson fan. Most often these accusations are correct because everyone is problematic and I disown them all. And then there’s also the conflict between the identity politics activists and the postmodernists. Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern? There’s nothing postmodern about it. Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice for particular groups, such as women, people of color, and gay and trans people. This kind of activism presupposes that these group categories exist and are a useful basis for political organizing. Postmodernists do kind of the opposite; they want to show that these categories—race, gender, sexual orientation—are contingent social constructs and are themselves potentially oppressive. This is why conventional feminist activists often hate postmodern feminism. Because the postmodern feminists want to show that the whole concept of womanhood, for instance, is contingent and potentially oppressive, and they think we should be working to destabilize and undermine it. And then the conventional feminist activists say the fuck? We need the concept of womanhood to organize around women’s political interests. How are we supposed to do that if we destabilize and undermine the concept of womanhood? And in turn, the postmodern feminists say—well, here’s a quotation from Judith Butler, the most famous postmodern feminist ever: “Is it not a sign of despair over public politics when identity becomes its own policy, bringing with it those who would ‘police’ it from various sides? And this is not a call to return to silence or invisibility, but, rather, to make use of a category that can be called into question, made to account for what it excludes.” If you take the first part of this quote out of context, it almost sounds like something Jordan Peterson could have said. The difference is that JP actually does think we should return to silence and invisibility—or does he? It’s hard to tell what he thinks. More on that in a moment. I bring all of this up to show that 1, the idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical, and 2, identity politics is not this dogma that must go unquestioned. There are sophisticated debates about this going on within leftist academia but Jordan Peterson either doesn’t know that or doesn’t care. He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force bent on destroying Western civilization, when in fact it’s a bunch of bumbling buffoons who can’t stop squabbling with each over every goddamn little issue. The only reason I can think of that the Left would appear to be a unified philosophical force is if you’re so far to the right that literally everyone who supports the economic and social advancement of disadvantaged groups looks like one homogeneous enemy. But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying, that he opposes all social progress for women, racial and sexual minorities? Well, it’s difficult to say, because while he spends much of his time comparing activists for these movements to 20th-century mass murderers, he resists being pinned down to any more specific position. I was maybe too harsh on Cathy Newman earlier. She came out of that interview looking bad, but she had a tough job to do. Peterson’s rhetorical strategy involves saying something that’s more or less uncontroversially true, while at the same time implying something controversial. For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like “there are biological differences between men and women,” which is obviously true. But he’ll say it the context of a conversation about the underrepresentation of women in government, which implies what exactly? So how do you respond to this? Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing against the obviously true statement, or you have to guess at what he’s implying, in response to which he can accuse you of misrepresenting him, which is exactly what happened with the Cathy Newman interview. The most famous moment where Peterson does this is the notorious lobster argument. So he starts by saying: There’s this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy. And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies, and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years, so, checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists. You’re saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters. I’m saying that it’s inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organizae their structures. The problem with that is that no one has ever said that every hierarchy is the product of “Western patriarchy.” This is such a massive strawman that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation of Peterson suggested by Cathy Newman in this interview. No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies. Even the anarchists, whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies, limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies. No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies, the hierarchies we’re interested in are those of gender, race and economics within our own society, to which the lobster case is a complete non sequitur. I mean you could use Peterson’s lobster argument in the same way he uses it to justify literally any hierarchy or authority, no matter how unjust. You could be an 18th century republican arguing against the monarchy and the monarch could turn around and say, “Well hierarchies are inevitable. God save the lobster queen.” [God Save the Queen] Oh dear god. My lords, ladies, and those that lieth betwixt. The present rumor of republican rumblings amongst the rabble has compelled us to summon you together. Let us remind you that nature hath so made the lobster that some individuals be stronger than the others. Therefore let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty be anywise impugned. And as for parliamentarians, well, let them vote for cake. Very good. Thank you. I need new roommates. So I’ve argued that Peterson is invoking the incoherent concept of “postmodern neo-Marxism” as the supervillain in a childishly simple worldview he’s promoting where these evil leftists are out to destroy “the West.” Now it’s time to inspect the other side of this coin. What exactly is “the West”? Well there’s an academic usage of the term “the West” that describes the intellectual tradition that runs from ancient Athens to modern day Europe and its colonies. Now a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct the whole concept of “the West” and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary and supremacist and justifies imperialism and all that kind of thing but we don’t have time for that right now. So I’m just going to grant that the West is thing, and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it. For Peterson the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism, individualism, the idea that each human has a spark of divinity, and he therefore equates it with “Judeo-Christian values,” a term more popular with conservative pundits than intellectuals historians. Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values with postmodern neo-Marxism, which he describes as anti-Western, collectivist, relativist and totalitarian. This framing of a conflict of ideas in terms of geographical chauvinism and external threat is inaccurate and scaremongering. Marxism is Western philosophy. Postmodernism is Western philosophy. If you’re really concerned about preserving the geographical boundaries of the intellectual tradition you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism. Likewise there is no feature of “SJW ideology” that is meaningfully non-Western. The very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty over collective dogma should be on board with. You could even argue that Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy, with its concern for human progress, science, and liberty. I think a lot people like listening to Jordan Peterson talk about the Western tradition, but they don’t seem to like reading any of it themselves. If you did read it you’d find a surprising diversity of thought, that doesn’t reduce to “Judeo-Christian” values. Much of Plato’s political dialogues are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism, suggesting that, far from being an invention of postmodernity, it was actually a pretty popular worldview among ancient Athenian pederasts. Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher David Hume famously said that \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.” Literally feels over reals. And meanwhile his contemporary the Marquis de Sade was advocating the abolition of morality, filling the churches with scat porn, and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion so decadent and depraved I’m not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube. This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism, and it’s is just as much a part of “the West” as Peterson’s soggy Bible-patting conservatism. But again, and I really can’t stress this enough, I don’t care either way. I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design. So… what do you people want from me? The lobster queen is dead, long live the queen.

       " 19: \" [dark ambient music] I like stuff. I like this, and I like this, and I like this. [belch] I like stuff and I want more stuff. My child! Hearken to my voice! It is I, Socrates. Oh no. What do you want? I haven’t seen you at the symposium of late! Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and it was getting me down. My child, without my guidance you have become a slave to mere appetite. Have you forgotten what I’ve taught you about the true meaning of happiness, the rational contemplation of truth and justice? Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don’t think it’s really my thing. I’m a dumb dumb and I like shiny things. Ah, but my child, these are pleasures for the pigs! Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself, perfectly exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys. Okay, thank you for your feedback, we’ll take that into consideration. Ugh, Greeks. Look, we all have wants, needs, desires. And we all want happiness. But happiness—what does that word even mean? I’m just a dumb dumb who likes shiny things, and these are questions really better left to the philosophers, which is why I’m not going to present my original ideas in this video. Instead I will be interpreting one of the most influential works of anti-capitalist philosophy ever produced, a series in multiple volumes that examines deeply the concept of the fetishism of the commodity. I am of course talking about “Worth It”, a series on BuzzFeedVideo about three men who are younger than me who travel the world and try different foods that cost different amounts of money and then say whether it was worth it. In each episode they taste a type of food at three different restaurants at three drastically different price points to find out which one is the most worth it. For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a $2000 pizza that’s made of gold, and a $1 ice cream to a $1000 ice cream that’s made of gold, and a $1 bagel to a $1000 bagel that’s made of gold. It is a lot of gold. “What do I do with the gold on my fingers?” “A ganjapreneur!” Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube clickfodder. But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper. We like to take it all in. [moan] The Worth It boys—Andrew, Adam, Steven—these are not mere content creators, mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue. They’re philosophers, spiritual leaders even, and what they’ve accomplished on YouTube quite honestly far surpasses the combined insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Sartre, Trotsky, Luxemburg, Gramsci, Lukács, Zarathustra, and even our dear breadmom, Kropotkin. I’ve of course read each of these great thinkers’ complete works many, many times, but I always come away dissatisfied, and I find myself yet again returning to the unparalleled masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve. See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question. Is it worth it? We may never know. Take for instance the case of the $2 regular pizza vs. the $2000 gold pizza. Which is the better deal? I mean how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle? Well, according to Karl Marx the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways. On the one hand there’s the use value, the commodity’s capacity to satisfy some human need. And on the other hand there’s the exchange value, the quantity determining the ratio by which a commodity is exchangeable with every other commodity, deriving from objectified labor over time, and expressed in terms of price. But let’s not oversimplify things. Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand the use value/exchange value dichotomy not as mere hierarchical binary but as a sort of Deleuzean rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity with as many sinuous interconnections as the truffles on the pizza itself. Am I making myself clear? I’m not. It’s almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon and not actually helping think through this any better. So, let’s throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning. Fuck this! I like stuff. And I like shiny things. Now that’s something everyone can understand, so let’s take that as the first axiom of the economic theory I will be developing in this video. So given that I like stuff and I like shiny things, let’s return to the question, is a $2000 pizza worth it? Well, it is covered in gold and gold is shiny, so I do like that. But the pizza itself seems kind of gross. It’s got squid-ink dough smeared with foie gras, Stilton cheese, black truffles, gold flakes, and caviar. These flavors are overwhelming, and they don’t make any sense together, the only thing they have in common is being really expensive. It’s like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump’s apartment. But Andrew and Steven sit there, with New York’s financial district for a backdrop, and they try to pretend that the pizza doesn’t taste like golden shit. “I’m honestly speechless.” “I feel weird.” “Is it the gold?” “I just ate $250” “I feel kind of like I’m committing a crime” “And that’s what $1250 looks like.” There’s this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2000 pizza isn’t worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they’ve done something immoral. It’s a feeling I’ve had many times myself, after spending too much money on some gilded piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul. Is there a name for that feeling? Well, I like to call it FUCKING NEOLIBERALISM In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia, a bad pizza covered in gold would just be a bad pizza covered in gold. You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza, but you probably wouldn’t be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt. To fully understand why a $2000 pizza is not worth it, you have to understand it in the context of capitalism. The price, $2000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza, and if you live in America, you have an instinctive sense for what that means because you know all the other things you could buy with $2000. For a lot of people $2000 would buy a few months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails. And there’s a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table able every evening worrying about how they’re going to afford golden nails. And it’s that awareness that makes the shitty $2000 pizza seem not just aesthetically disappointing, but almost obscene, or even immoral. But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem. So it’s not like those shitty YouTube comments that go “pizzas in Africa could’ve eaten those children how dare you” because the problem isn’t that Andrew, Adam, and Steven are bad people for buying an expensive flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese. The problem is that our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable these repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance. That’s why I don’t really agree with the philosopher Peter Singer, who has this idea that many of the world’s problems could be solved if privileged American college students would just become hedge fund managers and donate most of their income to buying mosquito nets in the Congo. I mean, sure, that would probably help with certain situations, but it’s not gonna change the fact the global economy is structured around cheap, exploited labor at the bottom, and $2000 pizzas at the top. Another way to approach this issue might be to ask: Who are the goddamn reptiles? Well, they’re certainly not the Jews, I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page I’m not blaming the Jews for anything. Except, you know, cucking the white race. But to be fair, someone had to cuck them. The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately. So the lizards are not the Jews, they’re not reptillians from Alpha Draconis, they’re not freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda. But the key insight is that they’re not even really the capitalists. The lizards are Capital itself. And what does that mean? Well, I don’t know. But it does make me sound like I’ve read a lot of Marx, doesn’t it? What I’m trying to say is that the problems with our economy are not just the product of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy. Of course some capitalists are terrible people, but some probably aren’t, and either way the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point. So the real point of the golden pizza is that it’s emblematic of the fact that the extreme economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable. If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would go something like this: Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system, because, although it’s good at creating large amounts of wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth but as the capacity to maximize human happiness. Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness. Here’s a question: Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy? It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve humanity, so what I look for in a good economic system is that it produces the most happiness for the people who are part of it. So if you’re willing to go along with that idea, the first thing we should ask is, does having more wealth make people happier? And we actually have data about that, at least within the context of our own economic system, and the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness up to a certain point. But the happiness benefit of income plateaus somewhere between 65 and 95 thousand dollars a year. One interpretation of the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold is that at lower income levels, more income means less stress about paying rent or mortgages or medical bills or college tuition, but once you pass the threshold more income basically just translates into more disappointing golden pizzas. If that interpretation is correct, then the current income distribution seems really irrational, at least if the goal is to maximize happiness. The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that national mean income is around $72,000—right in the plateau zone—but the national median income is around $59,000—significantly below it. Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year, several times the peak happiness threshold. So at least to my naive eyes what it looks like is that millions of people in this country don’t have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and healthcare, while a few million others are like constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something. But I’m guessing it’s even worse than that, because it’s not just that some people don’t have enough money to meet all their needs—it’s that they have to be poor while other people are rich. And since people compare themselves to others, that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties and resentments and social tensions. There’s a study of capuchin monkeys that shows if you reward one money for a task with a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a shitty cucumber, the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit. And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines. But that’s just how it looks to me. I could be wrong. I mean, I’m not an economic theorist and honestly I don’t really understand how the economy works. I don’t even check my own bank account balance very often. I make the videos, I swipe the card— So look, if I’m wrong and capitalism is good actually, just leave a comment explaining why and I’ll be happy to be proven wrong. But before you do that, let’s get some of the more obvious objections out of the way. Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs. Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money. Well, sweatshop workers work really hard and they barely make any money at all. And a lot of people who work for minimum wage have to work multiple jobs just to sustain themselves and their families. It’s actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive. But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers. Why would anyone become an innovator or medical researcher if they could make a good living as a janitor? Well, janitorial work is pretty important actually. Someone has to cook and clean, and I think people who do such necessary work deserve a decent living. But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring, and I think that the kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent often isn’t driven mainly by profit anyway. Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine, even though he could have made millions of dollars from it, because he just cared about humanity, and he was driven by a purpose beyond personal profit. In fact a lot of great historical scientists were upper class people who didn’t need to work for a living at all, and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity. So let me get this straight—you criticize capitalism and yet you yourself make money on the Internet. Hypocrite much? A few years ago I was a broke philosophy graduate student. And when I criticized capitalism then, people used to say Why don’t you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living? You just resent capitalism because you’re too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed. So if people who are failing under capitalism can’t criticize it because they’re just resentful, and people who are succeeding under capitalism can’t criticize it because they’re hypocrites, then, according to you, is anyone allowed to criticize capitalism? Capitalism may have problems, but it’s the best economic system there is. You wouldn’t want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China would you? Well, no. I wouldn’t. Hello. I’m Tatiana Tankikova, I’m here to defend Stalin. Fuck off! Dasvidania, fascist. So granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty. But that doesn’t mean that the current system is the best and final system for all time. My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that, but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability. Okay but… I like stuff. I like stuff too. I think a lot of people have this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything we love. I mean when I think of communism in particular I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity, undrinkable Victory Gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda—just an all around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion. And it’s not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies. But the stuff I’m worried about—booze, makeup, art, baths—these things existed long before capitalism and they’ll exist long after it. And I know different types of people will have different things they’re concerned about. Straight guys will be like WILL THERE BE VIDEO GAMES AFTER CAPITALISM OH GOD! And yeah, there will be. Tetris is a Soviet game, and that’s one of the best games of the 80s. [Red Army Choir] Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved if it were liberated from capitalist pressures. I mean look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies. Last time I was reading the only book I’ve ever read, Ways of Seeing by John Berger, I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising: “Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness: happiness as judged from the outside by others. The happiness of being envied is glamour.” And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour is very important to us. And by us, I mean the gays. The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy Qs. But isn’t it kind of true that at least in advertising the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy in the beholder in the service selling you shit. But the advertising function I think is an appropriation of glamour, not something essential to it. And maybe glamour would actually be liberated if it weren’t constantly conflated with advertising. So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that, actually, stuff is good. Glamour is good. Video games are good. Luxury is good. Baths are good. I mean, even gold is good, if you don't abuse it horribly. You know the most offensive thing about the golden pizza is ultimately that the $2 pizza is actually better. The golden pizza is an affront not just to people who’s medical bills it could have payed, but it’s an affront to gustatory pleasure itself. So I guess my final take here is actually champagne socialism is good. But I’m not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialists. I’m talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne. Alright, now that I’ve gotten these objections out of the way I’m finally really ready to get started. Part 1, what you’ve all been waiting for: How to End Capitalism Once and For All Well I don’t know. Who do you people think I am? I’m a socially conscious YouTube entertainer, not transsexual Gandhi. I mean according to Marxism we can’t just start the revolution whenever we feel like it. Capitalism has to fail, and that will bring about the conditions that make the revolution inevitable. So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen… I’m sure it’s bound to happen any day now…. You know maybe we should do something in the meantime. Uh so I dunno, I guess vote Labour, tweet radically, try to eat more vegetables, uh, try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people, and can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer. Noooo. No voting. Smashing. Well, you know what, she’s the one with the plan apparently, I guess just do whatever she says. [“Rebel Girl” by Bikini Kill] Tabby, why don’t you go take a bath? [Meow] Mm. Good kitty. Don’t close the door! Dear comrades, the Central Catgirl Committee has determined that ContraPoints is and always has been counterrevolutionary, bourgeois revisionism. The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video with a tribute to the immortal science of Tabbyism. [“L’Internationale” plays] [“Solid Goldberg” by Zoë Blade]\",\n",
       " 20: ' If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the Internet here’s what you do: you set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with toad venom, and you simply wait for the wolverines to eat your legs. Trust me, you’re better off that way, because if you look for videos on YouTube about race, well, here’s what you get: you get fascism, racist pseudoscience, racists debate fascists tag team title match tonight at 9, or, if you’re lucky, you get this: “So perhaps our legal system isn’t going around willy-nilly convicting innocent black people of crimes they didn’t commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to be black are making bad choices for which they have to deal with the consequences.” “Racism isn’t the explanation for everything bad that happens to black people. If blacks are getting shot and going to jail more, it’s their fault for committing crimes” That’s right, racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide to commit more crimes for no reason. I guess he’s probably gonna blame the rap music. Or deadbeat dads with their sagging pants. I’d say that this is the most common right-wing view of race in America. It’s not outright fascism or race realism, but simply the “classical liberal” view that racial inequality is the product not of injustice but of black people simply deciding to make bad choices. Usually this idea gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial inequality and dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things. They make me uncomfortable and I don’t like it. This is what I’m gonna argue against in this video. We’re gonna take a break from talking about fascism. In the past I’ve focused too much on the Alt-Right. I think we all have. I mean don’t get me wrong, it definitely is a dangerous movement, but it’s just not the most consequential kind of white supremacy that exists in America. In this video I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America, which is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color. And from now on I’m gonna try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow of Pepes and racist Odinists and neo-Nazi LARPers. All that stuff—it’s very last season. I’m kind of over it— [Knocks at door] Oh goddamn it. Hallo Leute. Fritz, get the hell out of here, no one cares about you anymore. Nein. Ich heiße nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich jetzt Freya. What? Ich bin jetzt eine Frau. Great. Get out. Well don‘t you want to hear about my transition? No. I don‘t care. No one cares. You‘re still a Nazi, get out. But I‘m trans! How could I possibly be a Nazi? That‘s a good question. It‘s almost as if you‘re an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense. Get out. She calls me a Nazi, and yet she‘s the one trying to silence my free speech, an excellent example of how truly fascist the left has become. Look if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny then why aren‘t you willing to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas. Well I‘m going to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out of my room. Mom, get out of my life! Well can we at least talk about the Jewish question? No. It‘s just ideas, what are you afraid of? I‘m afraid that I‘m going to have to blow the Tabby whistle if you don‘t get out of here in ten seconds. Ten, nine... Aw baby, come on! I thought you liked debate! You used to whisper to me so sweetly. [whispering] Well, not anymore. Well—do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax? [cat hiss] Okay, Jesus. I don‘t like doing this. I prefer to have conversations about disagreements. I don‘t enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat, but it‘s these people, they just give you no choice. Where where we? Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to people about this issue, they often claim to have this experience that leftists react to them in two ways: One, by saying “You’re racist!” and two, by saying “It’s not my job to educate you.” And I’m sure this isn’t as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience a lot of people have. And that’s not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this, no offense, and there’s no shortage of fascists, “race realists,” and “classical liberals,” who are more than happy to educaaaate people in their own special way. So as I see it, the left needs to step it up. Now to be fair, if you’re bothering random people of color on Twitter to demand they explain racism to you, you’re being kind of an asshole, and it’s true, it’s not their job to explain it to you. They have other shit to do with their lives. But I, on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out of my lane and whitesplain racism to you for the next 20 minutes. Because it kind of is my job. And I have all the time in the world. It’s a funny thing, time… [clock ticking] Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history? Do we have to take responsibility for things that happened a long time ago? I don’t even take responsibility for things I did before... July. This person, who the fuck is that? No, I don’t have any white guilt. That’s not what this is about. That’s just more white narcissism is what that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears. Here, I’ll pick you out a cotton ball… [Alarm clock ringing] 1 Freddie Gray On April 12, 2015, three police officers near a housing project in West Baltimore arrested a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray because he was carrying a spring-assisted knife that maybe was illegal? They handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van. “His leg broke and y’all dragging him like that!” When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck. A week later, Gray died of his spinal injury, while the Baltimore Police released contradictory and inadequate information about his arrest. This led to widespread protests all over the city, eventually culminating in the notorious Baltimore riots. Now you might be thinking, “What does this have to do with racism? If black people don’t want to be killed then they shouldn’t commit crimes and run away from the police.” Well, the first problem with that is that extrajudicial executions for non-violent crimes shouldn’t really be a common thing in a civilized democracy, and it’s a little alarming to me how quick you are to defend this. And the other problem is that that’s a very superficial analysis that refuses to examine the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and are subject to more aggressive policing. So let’s delve a little deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study. Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators brought this out as evidence that he was nooo aaangel. The implication I guess was that Gray simply got what was coming to him, that he deserved to die. But why did he commit all these crimes in the first place? I don’t think he was selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition. Did he just do it for no reason? Well, let’s see. Freddie Grey was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood Sandtown-Winchester. You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in a dilapidated row house with peeling lead paint. Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because it causes serious cognitive damage in children, leading to deficits in attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned with lead are seven times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system. But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven’t bothered to comply with the Congressional ban on lead paint, and as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been added to Maryland’s lead registry, and in Baltimore the vast majority of these children are black. Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent brain damage. And Freddie Gray was one of these kids. Now you might be thinking, “Well, reparations were paid out. So, problem solved, right?” Well, unfortunately no. What’s happened is a sub industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead poisoning victims—some of whom can’t even read a contract—and offer to buy out their structured monthly settlements in exchange for a lump sum that’s a fraction of the total worth of the settlement. And that’s exactly what happened to Freddie Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for $18,300. They also bought his sisters’ settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000 Gray siblings’ settlement for $54,000. Now I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad. But to understand how it relates to structural racism, we have to look at Baltimore’s history of racial segregation. Or, you know, we could just keep doing live streams with Richard Spencer. Interviews with Nazis, the new YouTube craze! Goddamn it. I need to relax. I need music. ♪ I bless the rains down in A F R I C A—I bless the rains! 2 Housing Discrimination Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore’s racial demographics, yellow dots standing for black residents and blue dots standing for white. Lead, race, lead, race. Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods. Why in the 21st century is Baltimore still so segregated? I thought racism was over. Well here’s the thing about that. When your country’s history is four hundred years of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation you don’t just get to say Oops, sorry about that. It’s all cool now though right? No. It’s not cool. And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not-cool things. Let’s look at how this shit happened in the first place. I hope I’m not being too controversial if I propose that a hundred years ago, America may have been somewhat racist. In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashbie Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious white Baltimore neighborhood. This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city passed an ordinance mandating the segregation of every residential block. Basically, the ordinance forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks, and vice versa, until the supreme court overturned the ordinance in 1917. “Well if the supreme court overturned the Jim Crow laws then what’s the problem? Racism can’t exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.” Well... no. That’s actually not correct. In 1934 Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote home ownership in the midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed. One of the FHA’s purposes was to establish a reliable credit system backed by the government, which would regulate interest rates and insure the terms of mortgages. FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating home ownership throughout the middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now remember as the golden age of the American Dream. But many black Americans were excluded from home ownership and the benefits it conferred to white families, particularly the family financial stability it enabled. So how was this exclusion possible? Well, basically the FHA, city governments and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle methods to enforce residential segregation and deny home ownership to black Americans. For instance: 1 Restrictive covenants When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore’s mayor created an official Committee on Segregation, which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents. These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health code citations issued against owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant. 2. Redlining The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were colored in red on official maps, giving the practice the name “redlining.” This effectively denied black citizens access to government-backed mortgages, which, in turn, left them vulnerable to— 3. Predatory lending Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers’ exclusion from FHA-backed mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly priced installment plans with abusive terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers to repossess and resell homes after a single missed payment. Many black residents had no choice but to buy into these exploitative contracts, and they often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting repairs in order to make payments, further contributing to the overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods. 4. Blockbusting Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as “blockbusting,” where they’d intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among residents of a white neighborhood. They would then exploit the fear that they created to trick white homeowners into selling their houses at below-market prices so they could resell those same houses at extortionate prices to black families desperate to escape the ghetto. The long-term effect of these practices was that many black families ended up trapped in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty, and aggressive, discriminatory policing. And even though most of these segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains unredressed. No reparations have been paid to the black families who were effectively robbed of home ownership during this period, predatory lending having cost black families an estimated $500 million in Chicago alone. But worst of all is that the segregation and ghettoization caused by government-backed discrimination of the last century is still ongoing. I’m currently sitting in my gentrifying white fucking neighborhood like one mile away from where Freddie Gray was arrested in a neighborhood that’s like a whole different country. Here’s the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore. Now compare that to the 2013 population by race map. If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is, and if the city still follows the same pattern of segregation today, and it does, well, it’s almost as if the effects of racism have not entirely been eradicated. And it’s not just Baltimore that’s like this either. Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans, Cleveland, L.A. All these cities are still segregated as shit. And it’s not like a separate but equal situation either. Compare the 2013 population by race map of Baltimore to this map of Baltimore police stops between 2010 and 2015 (that’s black neighborhoods in red, and green dots representing recorded police stops of black pedestrians), and finally let’s bring back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013. Now consider this information in combination with some scientific studies linking lead exposure and violent crime, and it almost starts to look like there’s some problems going on here that might not be solved simply by telling black teenagers to tighten their belts and do less crimes. But I don’t want to overstate the lead-crime theory either, because that only accounts for a small fraction of what’s going on here. The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation, the historical exclusion from home ownership, the lost opportunities, the bad schools, and this country’s ongoing insistence on treating a problem of injustice as if it were simply a problem of criminality. I know I said my interest in this topic isn’t a matter of white guilt, and it’s not. But, also, fellow whites… how do we sleep at night? [ambient music] “In this guided meditation you’re going to relax your body and release your guilt. You’re not responsible for what your great grandparents did.” “As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra: ‘Black Lives Matter are the real racists’” 3 Mass Incarceration Since the 1970s the United States incarceration rate has rapidly risen to the point where nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison. We now have the highest incarceration rate in the world, accounting for 22 percent of the world’s prisoners though we make up only 4.4 percent of the world’s population. More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black, and the black incarceration rate is almost six times that of whites. Now without even bringing race into it, it’s clear that America has a prison problem in general. Sentences are too long, there are too many non-violent drug offenders in prison, too many defendants are pressured into plea bargains, and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of incarceration. But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system. Now a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say: “If the blacks don’t like going to jail they should just do less crimes. Let’s do another interview with Richard Spencer.” You know what, why don’t we all interview Richard Spencer. Every single YouTuber. Free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda. Let’s get em all in here, every single Nazi in one giant live stream and then we can finally give the Jewish question the platform it deserves. Goddamn it. Where’s my toad venom? Look, it’s just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit more crimes. For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate, but black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it. And we’re talking about a drug that, at this point, white America has basically decided shouldn’t really even be illegal anyway. So we’ve now got a ten-billion dollar legal marijuana industry. And just look what white people are doing to weed. Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed—a ganja-preneur! It’s a strong, strong sativa, very high in limonene. It’s a great bronchodilator so I like to use it when I work out. Yeah so, uh, in fact in the back of a limousine is only, one of the only legal places you can consume cannabis. The whites are at it again. They have gentrified the marijuana. And now we’ve got white business people making millions of dollars selling the same drug that black people are still disproportionately incarcerated for having sold. A ganja-preneur! What do I do with the gold on my fingers? This is the most basic kind of unfairness, and if this doesn’t make you angry then either you’re really ignorant about this or you might just not care about black people. I don’t like to assume the worst of people but when I look at the state of the conversation about race in America, I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial executions of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color, and the vicious history of discrimination and its ongoing repercussions. And from those same people I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person who takes a stand or takes a knee or speaks up about this in any way. There’s an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil BLM is, and how it’s identity politics equivalent to white nationalism, and it’s unpatriotic and postmodern and racist. And I’m sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic. Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell’s nightmare. If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare, it’s locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses. But right-wing YouTube doesn’t seem very interested in using their free speech to talk about that. They’re too busy complaining about people… using their free speech to protest? How dare they! Now I can also anticipate another objection that doesn’t come from YouTube fascists or stock salad-eating basic white girl caricatures. I imagine some black people will probably watch this video and think “Where does this white bitch get off telling me I’m a victim? I take responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.” And here’s the thing about that. You’re actually right in the sense that “taking responsibility” or taking control of your life to the greatest extent possible is actually a good way to live your life as an individual. So by all means, don’t allow yourself to be defined by victimhood. Do take control of your destiny as much as possible. So I’m not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhoom. Please don’t do that. Go succeed as much as possible. But also, while you’re succeeding, don’t deny that oppressive circumstances exist. Yes, it’s possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances, but we also have a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions that create those circumstances in the first place. Wow I feel I just gave a great speech. Would you take my speech less seriously if you knew I’ve been drinking Bud Lite lime this entire time? Look, I even put a lime in it. Bud Lite Lime with lime! The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain too much about people who complain too much about racism! 4 The Final… Countdown I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest. First, there are actually more racial groups in America than just black people and white people, I’ve just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn’t three hours long. But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country, and someone should make videos about those too. Second, please don’t get all of your information from YouTube. I’ve put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the topic. Also, don’t get all your information about race and racism from white people, like come on that should just be common sense. So when this video ends what you should do is scroll down, smash that unsubscribe button, unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos, and then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color, and listen to what they have to say. Um, so I guess that’s it. I was just kidding about the forest. I don’t fuck with forests. I’m really more of an indoor tranny. So I guess I’ll just go sing a song about fighting racists. ♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord ♪ He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored ♪ He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword ♪ His truth is marching on ♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah ♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah ♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah ♪ His truth is marching on ♪ In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea ♪ With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me ♪ As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free ♪ While God is marching on ♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah ♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah ♪ His truth is marching on. Death to capitalism end patriarchy smash the binary hail Satan!',\n",
       " 21: ' [drone] ♫ Myself I shall adore ♫ If I persist in gazing ♫ If I persist in gazing [drone] ♫ In ga-a-a-a [drone] ♫ Ga-a-a-a-a-azing In 1989 a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically incorrect theory claiming that transgender women are not, as custom has it, essentially female souls accidentally born in male bodies. Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types: gay men who love straight men, and straight men who love themselves. For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term \"autogynephilia,\" new Greek for love of oneself as a woman. It’s a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves, and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which, okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard says— ♫♫♫ 1: Just What the Hell do I think I’m doing Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard’s theory is false. But a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I’m using my platform to potentially increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already face. After all, “autogynephilia” gives scientific legitimacy to our culture’s most twisted misrepresentations of trans women. “Would you fuck me?” “I’d fuck me” So it’s understandable that to a lot of trans women the prospect of this concept gaining cultural traction is pretty terrifying. However, I respond that, as one of YouTube’s leading B-list transsexuals, I’ve had several conversations with academics and journalists where it’s become clear that they in fact believe in Blanchard’s theory—even if the cowards won’t admit it to my face. So as I see it the damage is already done, and what’s needed now is an accessible, convincing refutation of the theory. I hope this video will accomplish three things: 1 persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong, 2 account for how a wrong theory became so influential and 3 move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people and open up a deeper discussion about what it really means to be transgender. Socrates—you know the drill. 2: Blanchard’s Typology The mainstream scientific view, endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, the DSM-5 and most practicing clinicians, is that trans people transition primarily to alleviate gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual and sartorial angst relating to one’s assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and medically transitioning to the gender of one’s psychological identity. This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view. However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory. According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations. He didn’t really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all are excused. You can grab a beer and just laugh it up. Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of... men—and yeah, I know, just hold your objections for the end. The first type are the homosexual transsexuals. These gay boys cannot get enough dick. And who can blame them. [slurp] Essentially the HSTSs are naturally effeminate gay men, who transition because 1, society is more accepting of them as women than as very effeminate men and 2, becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them since they do better as women in the heterosexual dating market than as male femmes in the masc4masc-dominated gay scene. The second type of trans women are the autogynephilic transsexuals. These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror. “I’d fuck me so hard.” Blanchard describes autogynephiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men—it doesn’t really matter because their primary sexual orientation is misdirected inward, leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming women, which is their true motivation to transition. Now I’m going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge that there seems to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits. I’ll replace the stigmatizing terms “HSTS” and “autogynephile” with more neutral language, let’s say Cluster A and Cluster B. Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic—that is, attracted to men—they transition relatively early in life, and are very effeminate as children. Cluster B trans women are mostly gynephilic—attracted to women—transition relatively later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods. When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid. I went through the mental list of trans women I know and found I could pretty easily sort them: Cluster A, Cluster A, Cluster B, Cluster B. But as I’ve thought about it more it’s partially unraveled. Without even leaving my own circle of acquaintances I can think of a trans woman who followed all the Cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans woman who followed all the Cluster B patterns but now exclusively dates men. So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here, I interpret them simply as correlation clusters that get fuzzy around the edges. Blanchard, however, takes HSTSs and autogynephiles to be two sharply distinct types, with completely two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition. And this is what I strongly disagree with: the notion that male homosexual strategy or autogynephilic lust are the primary motivations to transition, and I have a lot of backup here since trans women almost universally reject this characterization of their experience. Now, you’d think that’d be a major problem for the theory, but fortunately Blanchard has an airtight response to that, namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking liars. I mean that’s really the scientific ideal, isn’t it? A theory that cannot be falsified. It’s perfect. 3: The Man Who Would Be Queen Blanchard’s theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of sexologists before fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications had it not been given a major publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed Blanchard’s theory in a 2003 pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen. Great cover, Bailey. Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect. I have been triggered. Well done. Now Bailey, I read your book which, considering how much I enjoy your cream, was just amazingly bad. The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women, because it is acutely transphobic, but also kind of vivid and well-written, and it introduced a wide audience to Blanchard’s typology. The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals, including Bailey’s and his male research assistant’s observations that they’re super fuckable and natural-born sex workers. “I start upstairs to get the panoramic view and I see Kim for the first time, on the stairs, dancing, posing. She is spectacular, exotic (I find out later that she is from Belize), and sexy.” “Her body is incredibly curvaceous, which is a clue that it may not be natural.” “And I notice a very subtle and not-unattractive angularity of the face, which is also not clearly diagnostic on this tall siren. It is difficult to avoid viewing Kim from two perspectives: as a researcher but also as a single, heterosexual man.” Wow, Bailey. Great science writing. When he’s done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals, Bailey moves on to autogynephilic transsexuals, focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls Cher, whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of auto-erotic mania and transvestic masturbation. Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prosetheses while receiving anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction all to the accompaniment of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film. It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke. So well done, Bailey. You found an honest-to-god pervert. And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot. I admire it. I want it in my life. But as a transsexual. I mean Bailey—this has nothing to do with being trans. You just found a—you just found a person who built a sex robot. That’s not how Bailey sees it though. He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autogynephilic transsexual, claiming that Cher’s sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women who are not exclusively attracted to men. So Bailey’s telling is that autogynephiles are these unfeminine male masturbators showing up to gender clinics with bogus stories about how they always knew they were women in order to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia. Now what’s striking about this to me is that even for a defense of Blanchard’s theory, Bailey’s account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be. Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher pursuing the light of truth wherever it may lead, unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness alike. You’re so filthy. But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like? What objective methodologies does Bailey employ? Well, for the most part, it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago and chats up trans women, turning these stories into case studies for his book. Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research. You need a research assistant Bailey? The Man Who Would Be Queen is filled with sentences like “There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer, so I will just go ahead.” Alright you edgy fuck, let’s hear it. “Most homosexual transsexuals are much better looking than most autogynephilic transsexuals.” We appreciate the feedback Bailey, we really do. But is this science? It’s effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery that young straight chicks are hotter than middle-aged lesbians, and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation. And like the pop science cishet men have written over the past century regarding the nature of females and homosexuals, their observations about trans women are lacking some vital perspectives. This is what we “postmodernists” mean when we complain that science often privileges a white cishet male perspective. It’s not that I hate men, or male sexuality, I just hate that the male sexual perspective is so powerful that it gets to call itself science. It’s not that there is no objective truth, it’s that this represents a very narrow window on it. Wouldn’t anyone care to hear a different perspective? Well, how about mine? 4: My Perspective From my perspective, Michael Bailey is a lecherous edgelord. He’s a man who, when I was a student at Northwestern, was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident. Google it. Of course that doesn’t mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren’t true. Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard to sacrifice a trans baby to Beelzebub, it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctness of the theory, which might still be true. The problem is, it isn’t true, which I’ll argue at length in a moment. But first, it’s worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance among a non-trivial number of academics and journalists, largely because 1 it’s often presented as the only supposedly “scientific” alternative to mushy platitudes about women born in mens’ bodies and 2 many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard with extreme vitriol and personal attacks, resulting in the widespread perception that a bunch of triggered PC cucks are throwing a narcissistic male entitlement temper tantrum because Bailey and Blanchard accurately called them out as paraphilic fetishists. In her 2015 book Galileo’s Middle Finger, bioethicist Alice Dreger championed Bailey as the undeserving victim of a hysterical SJW lynch mob. But she gets so caught up in exonerating Bailey of the personal accusations against him and in telling a bigger story about academic freedom and how scientists are being silenced by PC cucks, that she doesn’t bother to check how good Bailey’s science really is, and ends up affirming the autogynephilia theory herself. Now I’m certainly not gonna deny that trans people on the Internet can behave like a bit of an angry mob. In fact I may be on the receiving end of one of those myself in about 20 minutes depending on how this video is received. But there’s not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression from the Blanchard and Bailey camp either. Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors, and Dreger is an advocate of the “narcissistic rage” theory of trans backlash against Bailey. Remember, according to autogynephilia theory, many trans women are erotically fixated on themselves, from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap to saying that they’re narcissists, and hence any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation is accused of exhibiting narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego. Furthermore, like so many other professors in recent academic freedom controversies, Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly “silenced” by PC cucks has not really gotten interfered with their academic careers, nor their continued authority to misrepresent people with less power than them. This of course assumes that autogynephilia theory is a misrepresentation of trans women, and that’s really the crux of this whole drama isn’t it? So let’s just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question, pursuing the pure light of truth, as we always do on this channel relying only on the facts, the figures, the scientific studies. Just kidding, if you want to read a scientific argument against autogynephilia, read Julia Serano’s article “The Case Against Autogynephilia” which pretty much sums it up. Because I know you didn’t click on this video because you wanted to hear about science. You came here because you wanted filth, and I’ll give you filth, Bailey. I know that’s what you want. And I want to give you what you want. I want to give it all up for you. 5: The False Dichotomy Filth is coming, don’t worry, but before we get there there’s one more thing we need to discuss. Advocates of Blanchard’s theory pretty much unanimously introduce the theory as if it were the only possible alternative to what is called the feminine essence theory. The feminine essence theory says that trans women are female souls in male bodies, that we are women from birth to death, and that transition is merely an effort to make our accidental exterior match our essential interior. People like Dreger will tell you that trans activists dogmatically adhere to this theory, and that anyone who challenges it will be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt. And of course, the only way to challenge it, we’re told, is to defer to Blanchard’s typology of homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals. Now I object to this framing of the discussion, because I don’t believe in Blanchard’s typology or the feminine essence theory. There is no feminine singularity that made a me woman from birth. I wasn’t born a woman, I was born a fucking baby. Just like everyone else. There’s no such thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence. There is only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you, all of which can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are currently changing for me. Now there is an emotional appeal to the feminine essence theory. I think most people have gender essentialist intuitions, and I admit I do feel on some level that I’m supposed to be a woman by nature. And in a sense that may be true. I don’t think I chose to be trans, and it seems likely that something inherent in my biology and psychology led me to transition, but that’s not the quite the same thing as essential womanhood, which intellectually I don’t think makes sense. I think it’s heartwarming gibberish. But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish. Sometimes you have to explain what being trans is to a person who believes that dogs go to heaven. And in most circumstances saying “I’m a female soul in a male body” gets the point across. Not all language is philosophical. It’s a lot easier to explain what being trans is in essentialist terms, because to explain what being trans is without gender essentialism requires a whole deep philosophical discussion that most people simply aren’t up to having. But the useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically minded people start putting these things under the microscope, and then they end up concluding that trans people are just fetishists telling lies about themselves. So you’re probably wondering, if I’m not a fetishist, and not essentially a woman, then why am I transitioning? Well I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was the primary reason. And shortly before I transitioned I made a whole video about that if you’re curious. You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom. When you decide you’re going to live as a woman you have to do it at the grocery store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family if you even still have a family. It’s kind of hard for me to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory urge. That said, is there at least some sexual aspect of being transgender? Well of course there goddamn is. How could an adult decide to switch genders without there being some connection to sexuality? The problem is autogynephilia is not a good description of that connection in most cases. And it certainly isn’t in my case. But I’m a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women, and cross-dressing in erotic situations no less. According to Blanchard’s theory I am therefore an autogynephile. It seems that I have some explaining to do. Well, here’s where filth comes in. 6: ContraPoints: An Erotic Life Come one come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie. Step right up you filthy freaks. One of the reasons it’s difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard’s theory is that even arguing against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and invalidating. Fortunately, I happen to have no sense of dignity or self-respect whatsoever, so I’m willing to take one for the team here. Get your clipboards out, gentlemen, I want to make this as easy as possible for the psychoanalysts at home. [static] I was born in 1988. As a small child I was not especially feminine nor especially masculine. I was not interested in sports and was just kind of physically inept. My main childhood interest was music, and I learned several instruments. In early adolescence I was misdiagnosed with OCD, the primary symptoms being spending too much time in the shower and too much time styling my hair. My sexual development was kind of late, and I never masturbated till I was 15. And I didn\\'t fantasize about having sex with women, or with men, or even about becoming a woman. My fantasies were kind of Platonic almost. I would sort of fantasize about women but in a very abstract kind of way. An early romantic disappointment involved my realization that women would never be attracted to me in the same way that I was attracted to them. In my late teens and early twenties I was a long-haired, smooth-chested androgyne, which suited me wll. It was around then bthat I first cross-dressed, when a woman I was seeing asked if she could dress me in her clothes and do my make up. God yes, I said. Throughout my twenties I was on and off in relationships where there was this feminization dynamic. More women are into feminizing boys than you might think. When I was feminized we would make out and not do anything penetrative, just sort of, little proto-lesbian things, you know? Now some women I was with were not into that, and some would practically lock their underwear drawers when they found out I had done it in the past. There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that altogether, but it didn’t last more than a couple years. When I had regular heterosexual sex it was like my soul had to leave my body in order for me to to get the poison out, as I thought of it. The cross-dressing was never a solo or masturbatory activity. There was always a partner, or sometimes several partners. Bailey are you paying attention to this? This is for you. What I liked about it was the way that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted with my body, how they would kind of treat me like a woman. I fully acknowledge that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic. There was a lot of short dresses and thigh-highs, And occasionally also a a BDSM submissive aspect. But over time I realized that the fetish aspect wasn’t really what I liked about it. It wasn’t humiliating for me to be feminized. It was affirming. And one day I kind of realized that I didn’t actually want to be feminized at all; I wanted to be feminine. In my mid-twenties I first really started paying attention to trans women and thinking about transitioning myself. But I thought that since I didn’t “feel like a woman” that I never would, and I thought that I would never pass and that I would just be a hideous parody of womanhood. Then about a year ago thanks to this amazing online queer community that we have now, I started developing more positive thinking about this. I’ve always looked a little bit younger than my age, but last year I also started noticing the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man. And that triggered really intense gender dysphoria. At the same time I realized that I would need to transition to have any hope of a genuinely genuinely fulfilling sex life. And at that point the need to transition felt so urgent that I could not wait. So I got Internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu and I started taking those in August until I could get a prescription at an informed consent clinic, and since then my life has drastically changed. I live as a woman full-time now. And most of the changes aren’t sexual, but the hormones certainly do have sexual effects. I now find myself attracted to both women and men. And the mere visual image of a woman no longer turns me on the way it did. Instead I need there to be a kind of interpersonal connection. I don’t masturbate at all, and I haven’t come in months. Someone please fuck me. I guess the critical thing is I’ve been wearing women’s clothes, my clothes, for seven consecutive months, and I have been turned on by it for zero percent of the time. So the idea that I’m some kind of transvestic fetishist is ridiculous. And I\\'m not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either. I mean, when there\\'s developments, I’ll check it out. But I’m not like \"ah yeah I have tits now that’s so hot.\" I mean it’s kind of hot. But it’s more about other people being into it is about me being into it. So as always my sex drive is directed outward at other people. The sexual aspect of my transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed inward, it’s about me wanting my sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body, or you know, at least as close as I can get. And since I started hormones it’s about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection, rather than intense, object-oriented male lust. [static] So that’s my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to politically correct cuckoldry or trans ideology. Now I’ve read enough Blanchard to know that this description does not by any means let me off the hook for autogynephilia. In fact, I’m what Blanchard would call a classic case of pseudo-bisexual behavioral autogynephilia. Pseudo-bisexual because of course all of trans women’s experiences are lies and because according to Blanchard I only like guys because being filled up with their dicks makes me feel like a girl, which is what I’m really into. And behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogynephilia, like anatomical, behavioral, transvestic, physiological, according to what you supposedly fetishize, and I’m turned on by sexually behaving like a woman rather than simply wearing female clothes or having female anatomy. And I mean, okay, you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary, fake, and pathological, but I think this is an especially unfair way to characterize my experience, and here’s why. 7: Autophilia in General I’m guessing most people would be pretty reluctant to admit they take any kind of sexual interest in their own bodies. It’s sort of like admitting you enjoy your own body odor. Ew. But how unusual is it to check yourself out, to take some sexual interest in the sight or touch of your own body? I’ve noticed cis men seem to really like their own penises, and taking pictures of their penises, and sending them to other peeople. Does that make them autoandrophiles? Are they behavioral autophallophiles? I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard. I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me, “It’s not for men, it’s for me.” What does that mean? It means she just liked wearing sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel hot. Is that cisvestic autogynephilia? Likewise I used to date cis women, I know what they do. And I can tell you that women touching their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon. Is that anatomical autogynephilia? Twitter user NathanOfOz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo, an article on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their own feet or running a feather over their skin as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length mirror and rubbing one out, possibly while squatting on a dildo. Can you imagine the level of paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if it were written by a trans woman? I mean it’s one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot. And okay, Cosmo’s sex advice is often ludicrous, but the point is it seems like it’s only with trans women where we feel the need to whip out the suffix “-philia.” It seems what’s going on here is a lot of pathologizing of normal female sexuality when it exists in trans women. But of course that raises the question what is normal female sexuality? 8: normal female sexuality Switching from male to female hormones causes your sex drive to be completely obliterated and then regrown in a new form, which came as more of a relief than I expected. I don’t think I realized the extent to which I felt like my own sexuality felt like a demonic possession or alien infection until I was free of it, thank God. When I had male hormones in me I needed to have an orgasm like every day, I was turned on mainly by visual arousal cues, I was at a Kinsey 1 relative to my birth sex, and I had a couple mild typical straight-guy paraphilic kinks—no not autogynephilia. On female hormones I initially had no sex drive at all but have started developing very different patterns of arousal. For instance, I never need to have an orgasm, I’m turned on mainly by interpersonal cues like intimate physical contact or close emotional moments, I’m at around a 70/30 attraction to women vs men, and the paraphilic kinks have vanished without a trace. Oh by the way for the pharmacologists at home this is 6mg estradiol and 200 mg spironolactone daily. So my interpretation of all this is that I now have what is a pretty typical female sexuality, at least for a girl who’s into girls. I don’t feel like I have some essentially male pseudo-bisexual behavioral autogynephilia. One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with elaborate terminology like this is that he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women are psychologically more like cis men than like cis women. His studies therefore a lack cis female control group, meaning he didn’t bother to apply his autogynephilia survey to cis women. But if he had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were classified as autogynephilic. Blanchard’s insistence on classifying trans women’s sexuality as a variant on male sexuality makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women. But how do cis women want to have sex, as walruses? I mean no judgments. This also explains his claim that non-exclusively-androphilic trans women are “pseudo-bisexual” because their attraction to men does not resemble gay male attraction to men. The idea is that these trans women’s attraction to men is not based on raw physical lust, so it is unlike gay male attraction to men, and is therefore “pseudo,” that is, it’s really an autogynephilic fantasy where the man is just a prop. But what about straight cis women’s attraction to men? Is that based on raw physical lust for the male body? I mean sometimes it probably is, and I\\'m not a cis woman so I can\\'t really say. But I kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust for the male body. That is, I suspect it’s quite different from cis male homosexuality, if I may risk painting with broad strokes. Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist articles alongside naked hunks but never had the circulation of its male counterpart, and later on ended up just being read by gay men. From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean men’s bodies are nice, they have great hands, great abs, great this part, that’s all great. But it’s not that great. And if you read pornography written by women—and notice that it’s usually written and not photographed—you don\\'t find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies. Like in 50 Shades of Grey (which I read for research purposes) there’s some description of Christian’s hot bod and his hot abs, but it’s not the main thing by any means. There’s a lot more sentences like: “To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat 10 adults comfortably.” “It faces a state of the art stainless steel—or maybe platinum for all I know—modern fireplace.” “Near the kitchen area in front of the glass wall is a dining table surrounded by sixteen chairs.” “And tucked in the corner is a full-sized shiny black grand piano.” “’Here’ he hands me a glass of wine. Even the glasses are rich. Heavy, contemporary crystal. It’s like a Crate & Barrel catalog. I’m getting so wet. Christian is established as a man of good taste as evinced by his contemporary crystal, his playing Bachhhhh at the piano. And that’s hot, because it’s sexy to be wanted by someone who’s qualified. It’s not enough to be whistled at by a catcaller, they have no discernment, I mean they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female, they whistle at me. And I don’t want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me. You want to be wanted by someone who with their exquisite and discriminating taste selects you, the protagonist. This is not a story about Christian’s rippling abs and his tight buns. It’s not a story about wanting a man, it’s a story about being wanted by a man. This is how the whole romance genre works. You emotionally identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who’s like a pirate or the CEO of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this guy wants you, the protagonist, usually singling her out over other more qualified women, and eventually giving up everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her. And a lot of these stories are kind of silly, they conflate female sexuality with women’s economic dependence on men in a way that’s really problematic, but I fundamentally resonate with the wish to be wanted. I want other people to think I’m sexy and want to fuck me. You know. It makes me feel like I have value and it fills up the terrible void inside. Is that so wrong? 9: Female Vanity The art critic John Berger wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting trope of depicting a nude woman with a mirror, and calling the painting Vanity. The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of women. The moralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical. You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her. You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting \"vanity,\" thus condemning the woman whose nakedness you depicted for your own pleasure. The real function of the mirror was otherwise. It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight. The notion of the vanity of women is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection. It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy looking at them, and are therefore complicit in their own objectification. I think that the concept of the autogynephilic transsexual woman is a combination of this trope with a homophobic trope. Misogyny casts women as narcissistic, vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts queer men as hypersexual perverts. The autogynephile is the ultimate combination of the two: the hypersexual pervert vainly in love with the image of himself as a woman. ♫ Myself I shall adore ♫ If I persist in ga-a-a-a ♫ a-a-a-a-a-a 10: Autogynephilia acceptance So this whole video I’ve been treating autogynephilia kind of like an accusation from which I have to exonerate myself. And I think that’s justifiable considering I’m objecting to misrepresentation, but some people might wonder, isn’t this whole conversation getting kind of kink shame-y? Is autogynephilia so wrong? Well, no. It’s not. It’s fine. There definitely are men who get turned on by wearing women’s clothes or thinking about having a female body, and as paraphilias go this is very harmless and I don’t think it’s anything to be ashamed of. But the question of whether genuinely autogynephilic trans women exist is more complicated. The reason most trans women consider the label “autogynephilia” to be such a stigma is that, as Blanchard says, women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women. Now, as I’ve discussed, the problem with Blanchard is he over-extends the concept of autogynephilia to cover pretty much any sexual feeling that a Cluster B trans woman can have. But I’m actually inclined to agree with him that being turned on merely by the thought of being a woman is a fundamentally non-female state of mind, and one that feels quite foreign to me. So a lot of trans women, I guess including me, have this idea that you can’t be both a woman and an autogynephile, hence the offense we take to being characterized in this way. However, things gets messier when you look into this some more. Are there some genuinely autogynephilic transsexuals? Well at first glance the answer is yes. I mean there’s always one isn’t there. In this case that one is Anne Lawrence, a disciple of Blanchard and a self-identified autogynephilic transsexual. From 1998 to 2011, Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogynephilia over the Internet and published them in her 2012 book Men Trapped in Men’s Bodies. Great title Anne, very provocative, very controversial, very politically incorrect, I have been triggered, well done. What is this cover though? Come on, Anne. Get a statue of Hermaphroditus or something on there. So this book is filled with stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty autogyenphilia-like fantasy and behavior. So what do we make of that? Well, a lot of this stuff, like fantasies of being women or having sex as women, or arousal during cross-dressing, are what the trans community has destigmatizingly termed “cross-sex gender fantasy.” And among trans women, particularly prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty common. You’ll see it all over the trans subreddits, there’s blog called cross dreamers devoted to it, it’s been written about by Zinnia Jones and Julia Serano. So within the trans community this isn’t even controversial, it’s not provocative, it’s not politically incorrect. But how do we make sense of this? Well, my thinking is that it’s hard to experience genuine female sexuality when you still have the evil magic of testosterone in your system. So you’ve got to get that out, and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away. But how is this any different from Blanchard’s theory of autogynephilia? Well basically it comes down to this: Blanchard’s theory claims that cross-sex gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential. In this theory if you’re an autogynephilic transsexual you are essentially male, and any facsimile of womanhood you attain can only be honestly understood as the expression of an essentially male sexual urge. I reject the idea that it’s causal or essential. And I think the strongest piece of evidence that it isn\\'t essential is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogynephilic admit that after transition the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes, yet they continue to prefer living as trans women. Blanchard made this observation himself: “Any viable theory relating to the etiologies of autogynephilia and transsexualism must explain the following well-established observation: Gender dysphoria, in young nonhomosexual males, usually appears along with, or subsequent to, autogynephilia; in later years, however, autogynephilic sexual arousal may diminish or disappear, while the transsexual wish remains or grows even stronger… The same conclusion is suggested by the fact that surgical castration and estrogen treatment—which decrease libido in gender dysphorics as in other men—usually have no effect on the desire to live as female or the resolve to remain in that role.” If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become women, why would they they continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away? Well, this is where things get really weird. According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only way to explain this is to shift the goal post and say that actually, autogynephilia isn’t a paraphilia at all, it’s actually a sexual orientation. So what happens when you transition is you actually pair-bond with yourself, forming a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman you’ve become. And if that sounds like it doesn’t make any goddamn sense at all, it’s because it doesn’t. A pair bond is a social relationship between two or more people. Are you saying that trans women are a man and woman inside the same— Why do they continue falling in love with other people... I can’t even start with this. This video’s too long, I’m getting cranky. Look this seems like the point where Occam’s razor shuts down Blanchard’s theory. Like okay maybe I subconsciously created a female alter ego with which my original male ego has fallen in love. But maybe lots of things. Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father. Maybe the elder gods ripped my primordial duality in twain and now I’m yearning for my female half. Or maybe I’m just a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while. 11: True Autogynephiles Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence’s book there are admittedly a few accounts of trans women whose primary sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does appear to be genuinely autogynephilic. And I’m not going to say that these people are lying about their experiences because that would be a terrible thing to do. Ultimately ContraPoints is not a channel about judging people. So I’m not gonna say that those people aren’t really trans. I mean I find it weird and hard to imagine, but whatever. I’m the one who’s into people licking milk off my tits. And wait till you see my sex robot. And look, if I had autogynephilic feelings, I would just tell you. I’ve already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn’t tell my own diary on my deathbed. But I just don’t. This theory doesn’t describe my conscious motivations to transition. And that’s ultimately the main reason most trans women hate this theory, not because of wounded narcissism or shattered erotic delusions. We just don’t like being misrepresented. But you know who does loves the theory? She’s been there literally the whole time. You know, I realize that by making this video I’m subjecting myself to a lot ruthless psychoanalysis, whether it’s gonna come from TERF reddit, or trans people who are mad at me for even talking about this, or, who knows, maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves. So you know what? Why don’t we just get that out of the way right now. It’s time to put this tranny on trial. 12: The Autogynephilia Trial of ContraPoints All rise. The Autogynephilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session. Judge Bailey presiding. Calling the case of the GenderCritical subreddit versus ContraPoints. Are both sides ready? District Attourney Cockbane ready for the subreddit, Your Honor. Ready, I guess. Your Honor, ladies of the subreddit: the defendant is a man. A full-grown, six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress. It’s really more of a hospital gown. The evidence will show that the defendant is not a woman but a male pervert role playing as such for his own twisted sexual amusement. [brandishes riding crop] Abigail what are you holding? It’s for horseback riding. You honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip, uploaded to YouTube by the defendant on June 13, 2016. [drone] Oh god. Fishnets, garter belts, corsets. If these are not the trappings of an autogynephile then I don’t have two X chromosomes. Agreed. Well, what you have to say for yourself? Well why do you think I owned all that fetish stuff in the first place? The court doesn’t need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals. I bought that stuff to do Rocky Horror. What? Rocky Horror Picture Show. I used to do Frank-N-Furter. Your honor, I’d like to admit into evidence the following photograph. That’s me at E Street Cinema in 2014. This one’s on the house KiwiFarms. Are you a Rocky Horror fan, your honor? Am I?? It’s just a jump to the left! ♫ And then a step to the right. Put your hands on your hips! ♫ And bring your knees in tight ♫ But it’s the pelvic thrust Ew. So you liked to dress up as another cross-dressing autogynephile. How is that helping your case at all? Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic but when you’re living as a man there aren’t a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try out cross-dressing. You know it’s basically Rocky Horror, Halloween, pretty much any time it’s socially allowed to be a freakish monster. And come to think of it the scary monster autogynephile is a trope I’ve played with since the beginning of this channel. The whole ContraPoints aesthetic is very like autogynephilia chic. I originally was going to have the narrator of this channel be more of a fictional character, the idea was to be like autogynephile Harry Plinkett. And part of that was that I kind of hated myself and I thought I was just disgusting, and part of it was that representing yourself as a scary monster actually does capture something of the horror of gender dysphoria, and part of it is that identifying with the scary monster version of yourself is actually kind of empowering. Like cis feminists, you have your thing about witches. Okay but monster version or not, real women do not wear fishnets and garter belts and corsets. This is just male fetishism. Well it’s true that cis women generally don’t dress that way, no. I mean, unless they’re doing Rocky Horror. It’s actually pretty popular. But I never wear shit like that any more. In fact it actually causes dysphoria because it makes me feel like a male crossdresser. Sometimes trans women start out with a fairly male conception of what women wear, I guess that’s true. A lot of trans women transition after period of sort of trying things out as a cross-dresser or a drag queen. But you know it takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion. Like, what did you wear when you were 14? ♫ Wake me up inside That’s what I thought. But also, why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters? Cis women do. They have some good ideas. Without drag queens and kinksters we’d have no contouring, no chokers. And what would we do then, Abigail, what we do then? I don’t know what you would do, I think I’d manage. Your Honor, I’d like to admit into evidence the following clip. Is there a way to smash my ribs in? I’ll smash ‘em in, I’ll smash the shit of of ‘em. These shoes are cute. And I\\'ll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames. Would you fuck me? I wouldn’t? Your honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and corsets in front of a mirror before posing to himself the question, “Would you fuck me?” This, your honor, is peak trans. Peak trans! Peak trans! How do we even need to have a trial about this? Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish, not sexual pleasure. “Would you fuck me” is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs and is what is known in the trans community as a “joke.” The corsets, the high heels, these were primitive efforts at clawing my way out of manhood. And they’re efforts that I’ve left behind. Now that I’m on female hormones, now that I live this way full time, I feel the way I’m supposed to feel, and I don’t need to lean on that stuff for validation. I mean I still do things that cis women don’t do. I sleep in a bra, which I’m pretty sure no cis woman has ever done. I do it because I need to feel something, God, anything, taking up space on my chest. And feeling that reassures me enough that I can fall asleep. Not so I can look at myself in the mirror, not so I can get off, so I can simply fall asleep. No one ever claimed that trans women are literally exactly the same as cis women. We have many things in common but in other ways we have very different experiences. Yes and you don’t have the oppression experiences that cis women have. Well you know what Abigail? You’re right. For the most part, I don’t. But it’s impossible for us to have an actual conversation about this because you’re just such a fucking asshole. And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression experiences, don’t have this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago. Go find someone who transitioned decades ago, and talk to them about their experience as a woman. Your honor, the defendant does not bleed. I find that pretty conclusive. As do I. Guilty as charged! 13: Final Thoughts I think some cis people will be congratulatory toward me for making this video. Some of them will say things like “why can’t all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their experiences as you?” Well I’m very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I’d like cis people to think a little harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this. It’s humiliating. It’s exhausting. And it’s required me to publicize a detailed analysis of my most private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me. I’ve had to discuss things that I’m honestly terrified to discuss because I’m afraid that people will never take me seriously as a woman hence ruining any chance I have at happiness. For trans women this debate is intensely personal and risky. Our lives and our happiness are at stake. Meanwhile Blanchard and Bailey are not just neutral, devoted pursuers of scientific truth. They have been continuously and needlessly derisive and cruel toward trans people. And they\\'ve misused their power as academic authorities to misrepresent and humiliate us. No part of my present experience corresponds to the core claim of their theory. I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity, but I am at core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself. So I have to hope for the sake of my own happiness that someday I will be loved by someone who thinks of me as a woman. Otherwise I’m fucked. This has been a rough one girls. I daresay you’ve earned a song.

Well, for freedom, I guess. And, like, American values? But what are those values? What kind of freedom is it that we have? The 9/11 memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan. There\\'s a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want But they\\'re too expensive and my feet are too big and I\\'m too tall to wear high heels anyway ugh fucking neoliberalism What even goes on in these big buildings?

The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between. There\\'s a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to and that sense is perhaps the most acute among middle class white men, who apparently were promised that they could be millionaires or movie gods or rock stars. The term \"special snowflake\" is used today as a slur against queer teenagers but it comes from the movie Fight Club where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become Adults only to find that they\\'re worse off than their fathers, that they don\\'t have glamorous jobs, they don\\'t have girlfriends, and, more recently, that even in the escapist world of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged. I\\'ve devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation: anti-feminism, alpha males, pickup artists, the surreal surge and support for a white ethnic homeland. But till now, I haven\\'t talked about the underlying causes and it\\'s important to do that because, the thing is, the white men aren\\'t even wrong that society is screwing them in some way. It\\'s just that it\\'s screwing everyone else even more. So the masculinist alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside-down. Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soy boy cucks. Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid IKEA consumers, capitalism did. So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists and trans people and unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy: the blood sucking goddamn reptiles Chapter 1 Capitalism and Spirit--oh god I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that \"a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping\" A leftist could easily have said that. We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic but there\\'s a spiritual dimension to it too. Much of Karl Marx\\'s early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul under capitalism: with the alienation of working not for yourself, but for an employer who appropriates the value of your work; with the fetishism of commodities: the investment of inanimate objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness; with the system of lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself: with fucking Comcast increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason No, I don\\'t want a landline. No one under the age of 60 wants a landli-- Of course, it\\'s not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise. Fascists and conservatives notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meaning and ancient customs, racial chauvinism, or fight clubs and that shit\\'s not really my scene I\\'m really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person but, I think that capitalism as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness, and here\\'s why: Chapter two Alienated labor Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks. Let\\'s come up with something new Chapter two shitty jobs Why is your job so shitty? Well, probably it\\'s because you work at the Comcast customer service call center and you spend your day dealing with whiny and titled white bitches who don\\'t understand that you\\'re just a lackey without any actual power and the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout at each other. You don\\'t have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company so you don\\'t really have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are a gear. The CEO makes 36 million dollars a year while you make $14 an hour, which means that a lot of the value of the work you\\'re doing doesn\\'t get paid to you, but goes straight up the chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards. The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you\\'re competing against your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off and if that happens, you\\'ll end up competing against other unemployed people for another shitty job as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee-shop Macbook person. This means it\\'s difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your shitty situation, because you\\'re all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles. And it gets even worse You could be employed by New Age reptiles, who force you to participate in team-building exercises, company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have a shitty oppressive job, but you\\'re not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating your life. You have to constantly pretend that you\\'re having \"fun\", all for the sake of maintaining the overlord\\'s comfortable delusion that he\\'s not your overlord. These lizards are smart and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you. If you work for Uber, they won\\'t even be honest about the fact that you\\'re their employee. They\\'ll call you an \"independent contractor\". You get to be your own boss and set your own hours. You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits, paid leave, or pension. So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right? No, PLEASE don\\'t transfer me to the billing department. They already transferred me here-- Chapter 3 Advertising Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video? What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey-- If you\\'ve lived your life in America, you\\'ve spent every day since birth assailed from all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals and cigarettes and sugar snacks, and now you can\\'t get no satisfaction. Jesus! People have been complaining about advertising so long, it\\'s come to seem like a basic feature of the human condition. But it\\'s not a basic feature of the human condition. It\\'s a situation particular to life under capitalism. I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn\\'t cluttered up with advertisements for-- Oh. So many fan-- Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed. A neoliberal tankie The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend nearly five hundred billion dollars a year doing. The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the fundamental assumptions of capitalist society; namely, there were all autonomous individuals making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being. Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational. For instance, randomly correlating the product with sexual desire generating new insecurities the product promises to alleviate associating the product with social status associating the product with random famous people associating the product with degenerate decadence associating the product with progressive social movements associating the product with communist revolution gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinean philosophy professor join the clone army completely original lighting gay orgies love cannot survive without diamonds Is this rational? Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests? Of course not. The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have, it\\'s to endlessly create new needs. And that\\'s a lot to keep up with and it takes a lot of stamina, which is why it\\'s a good thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus! Every evening, before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories for a sustainable blast of power! With all-natural ginseng and opium extracts, Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria and indifference to pain that I need to - get - it - in I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple almonds, then I take my Vitalimax Plus, and I\\'m ready to rip - it - open Vitalimax, for bottoms! Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires which they implant in your brain through advertising. Then, they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented, irrespective of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way. So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to want and then sell it to you. and this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it\\'s especially egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met. On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt, spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape, more than half a million homeless people and 13 million children who have to go to school hungry. and on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce $400 juice-packet-squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes and there are apparently Americans who are willing to spend 50 million dollars on Barnett Newman paintings. I mean, it\\'s a fine painting, It\\'s got a lot of great red on it, but is it really worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks? Is this what an efficient economy looks like? If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe. But shouldn\\'t the economy serve humanity rather than the other way around? If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment, and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden doughnuts we can produce What do I do with the gold on my fingers? Canto 4 Message to the Rich Alright you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up. I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics. I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early and you can assign as much or as little significance to that as you choose. But what I\\'m picking up at the moment is that people are getting fuckin\\' mad and they\\'re starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich. and you don\\'t just have to trust my intuitions here. Recent polling data shows that a majority of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism and almost a third support socialism. This is not the 80s anymore, you can\\'t continue to get richer and richer while the rest of the country is underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford health care. What you\\'re doing has been tried before and it doesn\\'t end well You can\\'t just stroll around town dressed like this and live in houses like this when there are millions of peasants who don\\'t have enough to eat. They will eventually try to cut your heads off, and judging by the mood I\\'m picking up on social media right now, if you don\\'t fix some shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking heads off., I mean they won\\'t actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you\\'ll have to deploy militarized police and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it\\'s gonna be a whole thing. bad for profits, and just all-around a real inconvenience for you. Nosey humanitarians will butt their heads in and they\\'re gonna make things awkward. The point is, shit cannot continue the way it\\'s going; something is gonna have to change. We can do this the easy way or the hard way: the choice is up to you. L1: Well, are you going to answer the phone? L2: There is no phone. There is only the side of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the soul of a soulless condition. It\\'s best to just try and ignore it. Episode 5 Message to the Youth Alright kids, so you\\'re angry. Well, good! The world sucks! There\\'s a lot to be angry about. What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger. I don\\'t think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it, so what do we do? Smash? Tabby, get in here! Sit down! Look, I know I\\'ve been kind of hard on you. Harsh words have been exchanged. But I need young radicals like you in my life. The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant, so I apologize. I never meant to hurt you. Baby, I\\'m sorry! I mean, look, I get it. Smashing is fun, but we also need to have a real plan, that\\'s all I\\'m saying. So what\\'s the plan? Revolution. Okay, yeah! Revolution! I mean, you\\'re right! Donald Trump is president. Fuck it! Revolution! We\\'ve gotta get better people in office. We\\'ve gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right? No, revolution. Ye- yes, I know revolution, but what kind of revolution? Like Project Mayhem? Gather your muskets ye militiamen and water the tree of liberty, what? No, I mean direct action. Okay, so like a general strike? No, end capitalism. Tabby, I\\'m not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don\\'t, but I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more substantive than just saying the word \"revolution\". Like, I\\'m in support of radical movements: Occupy Wall Street, 1960\\'s uprisings. I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy. They shift the Overton Window to the left, and they can have a big cultural impact. But none of them so far has ended capitalism and capitalism needs the state to maintain its power And we can change the state through electoral politics So why not direct some serious energy toward that? Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China But no elected politician has ever even come close to ending capitalism in the U.S., So why do YOU think that will work? What\\'s to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt-finance backed system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to? Well, you\\'re not entirely wrong, but on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet Communism were not exactly super great. and in any case, I\\'m having a little bit of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018. Shouldn\\'t we focus on protecting abortion and getting affordable health care and education and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals? What if the 2020 election is postponed? Well, then I WILL transition into you and become you unironically. Why not just be honest about your political stance? Are you a Democratic Socialist? Or would you actually support a revolution? Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels. Now, for you, Contrapoints, I mean, you\\'re still a heretic and an enemy of the Imperium and you are a daemonette of Slaanesh and everything like that, but I still like you. But what exactly are your positions? Um... Well... Kill everyone now, condone first degree murder Advocate cannibalism, eat shit Filth are my politics? Eat reptiles? Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists? Oh because Marxist analysis is boring and it\\'s more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles But you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Aren\\'t you discrediting yourself by using David Icke\\'s vocabulary? Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books Can the same be said of Horkheimer? Have you read Horkheimer? Yes. Have you read Kropotkin? Yes. Have you read Bakunin? ... No. You really can\\'t understand these issues until you\\'ve read Bakunin. Have you read Plekhanov? Have you read Goldman? Have you read Zetkin? Have you read Gramsci? Have you read Grindelwald? Have you read Slobodan Zarthusian? Have you read Sexus Arcanis? Have you read Slutsgonarevski? Tabby! I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards, and I\\'m telling you right now I ain\\'t reading any of that shit. and if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish is a prerequisite for talking to you, then no one is going to listen to what you have to say. I think I\\'m just gonna go, this isn\\'t really working out. Wait, Tabby-- Before you go, let me say one more thing. If you ever change your mind About leaving, leaving me behind Woah, baby, bring it to me Bring your sweet loving Bring it on home to me I know I laughed when you left But now I only, I only hurt myself Oh, baby, bring it to me Bring your sweet lovs Bring it on home to me I\\'ll bring you jewelry and money too Bu that ain\\'t all, that ain\\'t all I\\'ll do for you Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love Bring it on home to me I know I\\'ll always be your slave Until I\\'m buried, buried in my grave Tabby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love Bring it on home to me Bring it on home, cat girl.

       " 23: ' [Electronic music] [Electronic music] So why is it that humans just can’t stop killing each other? Well, I don’t know, what do I look like to you, some kind of philosopher? [plucks harp] So look, Thrasymachus, this is a question for God and the prophets, not for preening transsexuals who can’t get out of bed without a Bloody Mary. However, if I were to make a modest contribution to the subject, I would humbly offer up the hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because, well, violence is fun. And when I say that, I of course mean that it’s fun to be violent. It’s not fun when other people are violent to you. I mean, unless that’s what you’re into. That is what I’m into. Did I say you could speak? No mistress. Then Shut up. [Electronic music] Mm. It\\'s good. Chocolate-y. Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange is very uncomfortable to watch, and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence. Most of the movies I like depict horrible acts of violence. I mean if you’re gonna watch a non-violent movie you may as well read a fucking book. What’s disquieting about A Clockwork Orange is that it encourages us to viddy the old ultra-violence largely from the perspective of the sadistic protagonist, a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims. What’s creepy about Alex is the film encourages us to identify with him, and he kind of draws us in. I mean he listens to Beethoven and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever liked German composers. Also he tries the wine. Try the wine! Shh. So we watch Alex kick and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people and bash old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks, and all of this to triumphant classical music and show tunes. It’s clear that for Alex, this is all a lot of fun. So the question I wanna ask is, how unusual are people like this in real life? Is it normal to enjoy violence? I mean extremely violent behavior is uncommon, but part of the reason for that might be that most of us live in political circumstances where behaving like a violent maniac is... highly frowned upon. Plus there’s also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a conscience. And I think that’s part of the reason why so many people don’t really enjoy watching A Clockwork Orange. It’s not that they don’t enjoy violence, it’s just that in order for them to enjoy violence, they need some kind of reassurance that the violence is okay, and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed. I guess it’s kind of like sex. I’m not gonna want to have sex in a fluorescent-lit bathroom stall [(at least, not since I started taking this shit). I need candlelight to get me in the mood, you know, a little goddamn ambience. And you could say that the moral conscience is the fluorescent-lit bathroom stall of the human mind. You can’t properly enjoy violence with all that internal nagging in the background. But in that case, what is the romantic candlelight of the sadistic psyche? What do we need to get to a point where we can enjoy violence? Well, think about the TV show Law and Order: SVU, which has just as much sex and violence as A Clockwork Orange, but which is much more popular. SVU is a show where hero cops with no regard for due process brutally interrogate suspected sex offenders and smash them in the face with wooden drawers. You like that don’t you? I love it so much. You all do. I think a lot of the appeal of SVU is that it gives upstanding American citizens a way to sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes, while promising the moral purification of justified police violence. Oooh, so that promise is the candlelit ambience of the moral psyche. When we believe that violence is morally justified, when we think the guy being thrown around the interrogation room fucking deserved it, we become more capable of enjoying it aesthetically. Exactly. And I think this kind of moral lampshading partly explains the popularity of rape-revenge plot lines you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow, and Curious George Kills the Rapist. For viewers with too many moral hangups to get off on totally senseless violence, a rape-revenge plot line is a cheap way to establish the emotional precedent required for a gratifying bloody payoff. But I wonder if there may not be as much of a psychological difference between the “good person’s” enjoyment of justified violence, and the evil sadist’s enjoyment of random violence as we might like to think. Yes. The good person has a moral conscience as a kind of inhibitive influence, but once you get past that there’s a kind of amoral kinetic rapture in swinging, thrashing, stabbing, shooting, blasting, and burning: an aesthetics of violence and destruction. Now I, for one, hardly ever enjoy real-world violence because I empathize with the victim and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it. I mean, unless I get real frustrated— [drone] [baby crying] VO: “Shut up! Please just shut up!” “I can’t think with all this noise. I can’t think straight.” \"You\\'re so filthy.\" “It’s time to drink your milk” [moaning] But you know, when I’m playing video games, where there are no moral or practical consequences to any of my actions whatsoever, I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath. I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun doesn’t mean the thing itself is fun. The Sims is a simulation of life, and that’s fun, but life itself... is terrible. [Electronic music] To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help. I’m actually fine. I have tons of friends. I’m fine. I\\'m really—I\\'m, I\\'m fine. I’m happy, okay?? Here’s what I want to know: unless violence is fun on some basic level, why are simulations of it so fun that the game-play of most video games revolves entirely around it? Some critics have suggested that this is simply toxic masculinity at work, and that it’s a patriarchal moral defect that our media is so violent. And yeah, it’s true that men are mostly responsible for this, granted. But honestly I feel a little bit infantilized by the moral critique, since I like violent media, and I feel like I can tell the difference between real and fictional violence. Although, sometimes the distinction between real and simulated violence can get blurrier [glitch] than I usually like to think. [glitch] Singing: “Hush little baby don’t you cry, momma’s gonna buy you a mockingbird.” Joshua Oppenheimer’s disturbing documentary, The Act of Killing, chronicles the contemporary lives of the Indonesian gangsters who massacred millions of alleged communists from 1965-66. One of the killers, Anwar Congo, explains on a local television program that his torture and murder methods were inspired by sadistic American movies. [Speaking Indonesian] The documentary takes a surreal turn as the original perpetrators set to work producing cinematic reenactments of their youthful war crimes, stylizing the events after Westerns, Mafia films, and other Hollywood genres. It’s a particularly uncomfortable case of life imitating art. And on that topic, Stanley Kubrick had A Clockwork Orange withdrawn from British distribution in 1973, after the film was alleged to have influenced a handful of real-life assaults. Now I’m not saying that violent movies make people violent, and we know that most consumers of violent media never commit acts of violence themselves. I mean I watch violent movies all the time and I’ve never killed anyone who didn’t deserve it. VO: “So now ‘woke’ @ContraPoints thinks child abuse is funny. I personally drowned several of my babies and it was very traumatic for me.” Why did I become an SJW again? Hey! What I wanna know, is what’s the difference between fans of violent movies who are peaceful and those who are sadistic killers? Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster with a thousand dead communists under his belt? [Speaking Indonesian] So in other words, as long as you can justify it to yourself with some kind of flimsy excuse, you can kill without remorse. And I imagine it also helps when the US-backed government of your country endorses the killing and you never have to face any consequences for it. What’s interesting to me is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence is psychologically identical whether or not your justification rationally holds up or makes any sense. In other words the psychology of a righteous sadist may not differ from that of an evil sadist, except that the former has better reasons backing him up, or lives in a better political situation. But hold on, is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist? I think it’s okay to enjoy violent movies, but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence? What would be helpful here is an example, some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous, and that a lot of them probably enjoy. Unfortunately, my audience is morally superior, and none of them would ever enjoy such a thing. [Classical music] VO: “@ContraPoints has completely libbed out and can’t stop wringing her hands over a poor little Nazi getting hit in the face. Awww.” Alright, alright. Let’s grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable. Let\\'s say it’s morally required even. Well, why don’t we bring everyone on board. Suppose there’s a Nazi TERF and he’s about to punch a baby, and punching the TERF Nazi is the only way to stop him punching the baby. Socrates, is it just to punch the baby-puncher? VO: “ContraPoints’ sponsors would like to apologize to the baby community for this video’s ongoing trivialization of infanticide. They’d also like you to know that some of Natalie’s best friends are babies, and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.” Why are we still even still talking about this over-discussed Nazi punching bullshit? I guess part of it is that it’s the only actual recent example of far-left violence in America that anyone seems to be able to dig up. Not for long bourgeois dogs! Catgirls of the world unite! Tabby, could you bring it down just just just 27 notches or so? [Hiss] Why don’t you take a second to relax. Just chill out a little bit. Here, have some spiked milk. [Disco] That is having a very interesting effect on her. I guess my continued uneasiness with leftist “punching” discourse—whether it’s Nazis or TERFs or whatever—is twofold. First there’s just the optics problem. We want to convince people that, for instance, trans women are not creepy men who want to assault cis women. And I can\\'t help but wonder, is the slogan “kill all TERFs” really the most effective way to convey that message? And I realize the costume I’m wearing is not the best for making this point either. But you know, I just didn’t plan well. The other worry has to do with when violence stops being strategic and starts being fun, as in our collective enjoyment of the Richard Spenser punch. Because then it’s not just that we’re saying sometimes preemptive violence is necessary to prevent worse crimes. It’s that we\\'re actively fucking enjoying it. And any time real violence becomes fun, that’s a little alarming, because even if your actions are genuinely justified, you don’t want to get in the habit of having fun with real violence, because the violence will continue to be fun whether or not your justifications are any good. Though I agree there’s something sort of inherently liberal about this anti-sadism hang-up. For most of history it was just accepted that war involved a certain amount of rape and pillage, and that executions were entertaining public spectacles. As a boring French postmodernist called… Michel Foucault [mispronounced] pointed out, in the 18th and 19th centuries there was a so-called humanitarian revolution that was suddenly ashamed of overt sadism with respect to criminal justice and treatment of the mentally ill, replacing brutal executions with intricate techniques of discipline. And a boring French communist called Alain Badiou [overpronounced] argued that this contemporary ethics based on pity and tolerance is actually just fucking neoliberal bullshit that encourages first-world people to stage third-world \"humanitarian interventions\" that look a lot like invasions for some reason, as well as opposing genuine liberation movements in those very same countries on the grounds that such movements amount to violent ideology, the bourgeois liberals claim. So I guess in a sense my weird hang-up about violence benefits the people in power, since you have to break a few eggs to make a communist utopia, and sometimes to make political progress you have to tar and feather some folks and cut their heads off just a little bit or punch them in the fucking face. Now I realize that all the non-leftists watching this are absolutely horrified right now, and they’re thinking, “What’s to stop your violent revolution from becoming just as bloodthirsty and unjust as the Indonesian gangsters killing communists?” To which I respond, well that’s an easy one: it’s because my side are the good people and your side are the bad people. I’m so sorry. Seriously though, that is a pretty good question. But before I answer it, what if I change the subject to avoid how much of a problem it is for the argument I’m making? Isn’t all politics kind of violent? What about capitalism? Politics is the practice of organizing groups of human beings, and it’s the relations of power that maintain or disrupt that organization. So there’s always violence or the threat of violence in there somewhere. In our own society, police will use violence against us if we disobey the law or are black. And even when white people do obey the law, there’s always the implicit threat of police violence, including the potential arrest and incarceration of pretty much every citizen who doesn’t have enough money to— Let’s talk about Western values. According to the great tradition of European political thought, sovereign power is justified by the social contract. In other words, we all consent to be governed because it’s in our own interest. Except it’s really hypothetical consent more than anything, because no one actually asks you and you can’t say no. Wait a minute… Shhh! I guess if you live in a liberal, capitalist society, it’s pretty easy to see how fascism and revolutionary movements are inherently violent, and how those political situations generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish. What’s harder to see is how the same tendency spills out at the seams of our own supposedly humane society. We think of the police as peacekeepers, not killers, yet it’s not unheard of that oh… Oh no. Oh god. Likewise we think of our wars as liberation projects or humanitarian interventions, but when you put real human beings in combat situations, the nature of war has a way of just oh… Oh god. No. Fuck. We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgment on sadism, but sadistic violence isn’t even necessarily the worst thing that can happen to people. There’s also the quieter structural injustices that lead to millions of people starving, or workers throwing themselves out of windows at the iPhone factory, or the lowkey normalization of sexual assault in supposedly civilized countries, none of which requires so much as a single cackling maniac. So in order to think about this intelligently, we have to weigh the risk that revolutionary violence will spin out of control and lead to sadistic mayhem, against the risk that our complacency with the injustices of the status quo will make us quiet enablers of more subtle but equally unjust forms of violence. And I don’t feel confident enough to say which one I think is the bigger risk. But I do know I don’t trust the politics of anyone who doesn’t acknowledge serious problems with both options. So— —in conclusion— —is violence good? Or is it bad? I guess we’ll never know. [Ambient music] You know, with any true philosophical question, there always comes a point where you realize that all the rationalizations you tell yourself for all the things you believe and do just don’t really make any sense. And that’s when it’s time to stop thinking about it, you know? Just go do the fucking laundry. Drink some wine. I don’t know, do whatever. Look, what do you want from me?

       " 24: ' [Saint-Saëns: “The Aquarium” from Carnival of the Animals] Hello boys. I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me “degenerate,” but I’m still not sure what that means. I try to be open to criticism, so I’ve decided that what I need is a glorious knight of wisdom to set me straight, and I think I’ve found just the man. Some call him the valiant champion of mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant paladin of the Fourth Reich—but to this priestess of blasphemies he’ll always be: The Golden One. “A young prince, chosen to take the mantle of the ages—“ Oh my god. Look at his butt. Oh my god. Daddy, can I have some meat? Looks like meat’s back on the menu, boys! [Roar] Oh, Daddy. You know, Lars, things have really changed since the last time we talked. I’m a fair maiden now—to a certain extent—and I’ve been chaste since I started my transition, so, in a sense, I’m a virgin. And I don’t know about the rest of these decadent sluts but I for one care about a little thing called purity. So, now that my decade of gender-dysphoric, alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming to a close, I think I’m really ready to begin the training, master. But first, let us fend off degeneracy by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lakewater and pure absinthe. It’s time. [gong] [“Alone” by Heart] [R&B] [Laugh] What? Is this is the bad kind cultural appropriation? It is isn’t it. zMmmm they\\'re shiny and I want them. It\\'s not my fault black people have good ideas. What am I supposed to do, not steal them? I’ll pop it out. Alright thou resplendent champion of the north, hit me with your finest wisdom. “I’m going to go train some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror. That’s always a nice thing to do.” Well, at least we agree on something [door open] Aha! Autogynephilic narcissist exposed! Abigail, isn’t not invading women’s bathrooms like your whole thing? Misogynistic mental illness confirmed! Abigail, what is your damage? Are you okay? How’s your mom doing? Is everything alright? [Rossini, “William Tell” Overture] You wanna get in the tub? Ew. It’s your loss, babygirl. And your gain, sweet prince. He has an Instagram. And it’s just delectable. Meat’s back on the menu boys. He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval. What ho ye jaunty lads! My captain, my King! Yaaaas! If the Golden One didn’t exist I would have to invent him. I need him. And maybe you need me too, Lars. I’m the moon to your sun, the, uh, Brünnhilde to your Siegfried. As you become more of a burly masc, I become more of a silky femme. But you know, I’m noticing that even though you’re straight, you don’t seem super interested in the bodies of the women in your life. Now, this is just a casual suggestion, but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like me. I’m not like the other girls. I’ve got the Ts and the D. On second thought, leave trans women alone. I don’t want that blood on my hands. Well, this is no longer a relaxing bath. And that’s why we never bathe with fascists. [Beethoven, Symphony 1, Mvt 4] Well, I blocked my T, I popped my E. Let’s talk about degeneracy. What are people talking about when they call something or someone “degenerate”? Well, let’s look at some examples from my YouTube comments section and see if we can figure it out from context. “transgender communist degenerate” “kill yourself you fucking degenerate tranny freak\" “degen tranny lel” “Trannies grow out of their degeneracy by the time they are senior citizens, or at least that’s what I would assume since you never see old dudes in dresses, lol what’s up with that?” “This is degeneracy. You ought to be slung from a tree.” Everybody likes to rhyme. “you little homos are future cannon fodder. A bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs. The End.” Aww, these people are trying so hard to upset me. They’ve only got one card in the deck though, alas. Anyway, what I’m gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuckboys is that, like burly Nord and his fair maiden, the accusation of “degeneracy” is usually paired with a loathing of queerness. Now it’s not always just about queerness, in fact fascists and social conservatives use the word \"degeneracy\" as a catchall term for to refer to queers, non-whites, communists, “communists,” people with disabilities, basically anyone who gets killed when the fascists win. But where does the word degeneracy come from? Let’s watch an instructional video to learn more. The word “degenerate” comes from the Latin prefix de-, which means away from, and the Latin word “genus,” which means race or kind. So to be degenerate is to no longer be of your race or kind. And if you think this already sounds pretty fashy, you’ve been paying attention. The current usage of the term “degenerate” crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian proto-evolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing colonialist awareness of supposedly “inferior” ethnic groups gave rise to “degeneration theory,” the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution. Hold on, aren’t these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism? The exact same dingbats, yes. And one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat Arthur de Gobineau, one of the intellectual grandfathers of Nazism. Gobineau wrote a book called Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed the idea of the Aryan master race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos, and gave the word “degenerate” its modern fashy definition. M’lord? \"The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins, continual adulterations having gradually affected the quality of that blood....in fact, the man of a decadent time, the degenerate man properly so-called, is a different being from the racial point of view, from the heroes of the great ages....I think I am right in concluding that the human race in all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood....\" Notice that the “degenerate man” is the product of a “decadent” time. And “decadence” is a concept closely related to degeneracy. “Decadence” literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies a fall from a previous state of grace. By the late 19th century in Europe, concerns about decadence were everywhere in the European cultural imagination. During this period, German nationalist composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning Jewishness in music—which he first published under the pseudonym “Freigedank,” which literally means freethought. That’s right, he pulled the goddamn free speech card. [airhorn “Turn Down for What”] Then the Jewish doctor Max Nordau published a pseudo-medical book called Degeneration accusing Wagner and other contemporary artists of degeneracy. And around the same time a bunch of queer, absinthe-swilling artists reclaimed the word decadence as the title of their movement. Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence. It was 4chan writ large. So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly new then. Not at all. The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive goes back at least as far as the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to speculation about what causes civilizations to decline. And one of the hypotheses was that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence left the Romans vulnerable to butch Visigoths and Vandals. Is there any truth to that? No. It’s vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives. The “decadent” emperors—Nero, Caligula, Elagabalus—reigned from the first to the third centuries. The empire didn’t collapse till the end of the fifth century, which leaves at least two hundred years between the decadence and the collapse, at which time the Empire was thoroughly Christian. And in any case, the Eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand years. Well, hail Caligula! But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient civilizations collapsing because of the queers. Here’s “feminist” Camille Paglia on how the transgenders destroy civilizations. “The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture. As a civilization is starting to, uh, unravel.” Hang on a second. I’m gonna need to shift up a gear for this. “Okay, and you find again and again in history, in the Greek art, you can see it happening. All of a sudden there’s a kind of, uh, you know, the sculptures of um handsome nude young men athletes that used to be very robust, okay, in the archaic period, suddenly begin to seem like wet noodles toward the end, okay? People who live in such times feel that they’re very sophisticated, they’re very cosmopolitan.” [belch] “’Homosexuality, heterosexuality, so what, anything goes’ and so on.” “But from the perspective of historical distance you can see that it’s a culture that no longer believes in itself, and then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity on the edges, whether the Vandals or Huns, or whether they’re the barbarians of ISIS, you see them starting to mass outside of the culture, and that’s what we have right now.” “There is a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect between the infatuation with the transgender movement in our own culture and what’s going on out there, okay?” “That’s why I’m concerned, I feel it’s ominous, I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.” Riley J. Dennis. Why did you destroy ancient Rome? So the idea is that our infatuation with effeminate decadence means we’re going to be destroyed by real men—you know, like ISIS. This doesn’t deserve a response. We’re moving on. Where does fucking Nietzsche fit into all this? Oh god. Do we really have to do this? So there’s this dead German asshole named Friedrich Nnnn, who’s every 19-year-old edgelord’s favorite philosopher. Hey baby, the ladies tell me I’m Apollonian in the streets, Dionysian in the streets—in the sh— Shhhhhh go to sleep. Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western culture, especially Christianity, is “decadent,” in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society, we have all these hang ups about guilt and sin and the afterlife. And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with people who are weak and sick, and that they repress our basic biological instinct to value strength and beauty and worldly happiness. In practice this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into. There’s a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea of universal human equality to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryan studs, and then there’s the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about like fucking Christian morality man and reinstate the cult of Dionysus, which, okay, I’d be down to go to that party, especially if we don’t have to talk about Nietzsche. [airhorn “Turn Down for What”] What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism was really kicking into gear, European society was already primed with a couple centuries of degeneracy discourse. Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of National Socialism. Namely: 1. The German people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay. 2. Jews, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, and the disabled are degenerate elements that contribute to decay. And 3. The degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure the health and existence of the organism. So there you have it: the history of degeneration theory from Foppington to Fascism. Well thanks for the history lesson, doc. One particular thing I’ve noticed about modern fascists is they’re especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white babies. Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it’s white people they think should breed like rats. And they specifically loath anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction, including, as they see it: being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta male, being a slut, being a feminist, not getting married, not having kids, having kids that aren’t white, masturbating, looking at porn, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, using birth control, having abortions. [To the tune of “My Favorite Things”] Condoms and orgies and mass immigration Malt liquor 40s and miscegenation Boys who use dildos and girls with cock rings, These are my favorite degenerate things. Very cute. But don’t you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol? Oh goddamn, fine, we’ll talk about the alcohol thing. There’s like ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and they look up to me, so I have to be responsible and I hate it. So look, if you’re gonna drink, I’m certainly not gonna stop you, but don’t even think about driving, okay? Drink lots of water, and pace yourself. There’s plenty of time to be blackout when you’re dead. And you’re gonna be if you don’t take it slow. Alcohol is dangerous, it’s unhealthy, it’s only fun in moderation, and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people. So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason. I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good. Where were we? Absinthe with coffee and bitchy sarcasm Estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms Antifa furries and enby drag kings, These are my favorite degenerate things. [ambient music] Hi there. I hope you’re having a soothing degenerate bath. What I want you to do is just lie back and try to relax, and I’m just going to slowly start to drip hot candlewax all over— [crash] [drone] So for fascists and identitarians everything that doesn’t directly contribute to the greater cause of white procreation is degenerate. And individual fascists differ on what those things are. Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate, because, apparently, gay people can’t raise children. Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one subservient white woman, because they view this situation as the perfect factory for churning out clean-cut heterosexual white kids. And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get basic social conservatism. So this really isn’t just about fascism, though I do like to talk about the fascists, because they have the biggest muscles Speaking of which, a lot of rightists have realized that in the 21st century, the social conservative position is not very cool. So what what they do, is they say of course they have no problem with individual homosexuals, but only with “the gay agenda.” What they have a problem with, essentially, is queerness. Now, what is queerness? Well, people have all kinds of scholastic disputes about this. But in its most generic sense it means that you have some kind of weird sex thing, either your gender’s all fucked up or you have creative taste in sexual partners. But unlike the words “homosexual” or “transgender,” “queer” is tinged with a connotation of rebellion, often rebellion against the hetero-normative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity. So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they’re willing to tolerate gay and transgender people, but only as long as you shut up about it, conform to straight society, and try to act as normal as possible. What they can’t stand is loud, non-conformist queerness, because think of the children. We’re talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, genderfucks, kinksters, polyamorists, sing it with me—these are my favorite degenerate things. To fascists, the pursuit of individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race. So in a sense, traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than communism, which only demands communal ownership of the means of production. At least in theory communism doesn’t tell you what gender to be, or who and how to fuck. In practice, though, there’s not a single position on the political spectrum that’s immune to complaining about degeneracy. While I was researching this video I randomly came across an article from an American communist newspaper from 1976 that claims, “While we Communists oppose attacks on anyone by the bourgeoisie, including homosexuals, we do not uphold homosexuality as a democratic right. Homosexuality is a form of social sickness, a form of social perversion. It is a form of bourgeois ideology which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom. Homosexuality arose from class oppression and the oppression of women.” Jeez, fellow degenerates, we’re kind of short on allies out here huh? We’ve got the fascists calling us sexual Bolshevists, and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents. Why does everyone hate decadence so much? Is pleasure really so wrong? [Beethoven, Symphony 1, Mvt. 4] [cackle] Listen: I don’t want my position to be misunderstood. I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and procreative. And you know, that’s probably for the best. Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running. All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights in peace. My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind. In the perfect society created by me, there’d be plenty of beefy studs around, so don’t you worry about that. And that’s the difference between me and the fascists. I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist, and—this is the important part—where people who are not like me are simply allowed to exist. Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist. The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is to be the only survivor. So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests, which is to say bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a giant tax-exempt drain on the economy, well, you can certainly tolerate the existence of queer people, who crack Nazi codes, and write you musicals, and sing you songs. So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what, fine. Go make white babies. But I really must insist upon the my right, and the right of all degenerates, to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race-mixing, sexual anarchy, and rock ‘n roll.

And if we don’t stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization as we know it. I want you imagine the faces of your wives and children. Picture their pure, white, innocent faces. Now, watch as those same wives are violated, and those same children dashed to pieces under the black boots of the Third World horde.

Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising. So let’s accept that all of that’s true. The game’s rigged. Fine. Now how do you respond to that situation? Do you change nothing about your strategy at all and then blame the system when the predictable happens? Or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?

Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes between private property and personal property, right? You’re allowed to own possessions, you just can’t exploit people by owning the means of production. Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves. Well, you should feel bad about that.

Yeah, we’re gonna need to do something about that too. Now hold on, getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing, but Marx is a foundational thinker in the history of progressive political— I’m not talking about getting rid of Marx, I’m talking about giving him a makeover. I mean just look at the cover of that thing. It's making me depressed just looking at it. Red and gold, what is this foreign shit, like a Chinese or a Soviet flag? It’s un-American. I don’t trust it. I don’t like the cut of its jib. So you want a Marx-Engels Reader wrapped in an American flag? Oh, I can do you better than that. Let’s start with a gradient. Add a grid. Maybe a wave grid. Let’s get some shiny fonts. Maybe a bust. A pink bust. With 3D glasses. Pink glasses. Maybe some palm trees. Aw yeah. [a e s t h e t i c music] Or how about this: lots of brands. More more more. Oh my god. It’s beautiful. Okay, one more, one more. A pink field. Chick lit. Yassss girl yassss. I just realized that I actually hate you. [knocking] Hello fellow whites, do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and a future for white children? Get the hell out of here before I smash your face you Nazi bitch. Effective, isn’t it? Well, I see your point. But this whole Antifa thing. I can’t help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective, if there’s some way you can nooooooooooot do thaaaat. Are you saying we shouldn’t punch Nazis? I’m saying if 30,000 people show up to counterprotest Nazis, you won’t have to. [Matrix music] But that means getting 30,000 people on your side, which you’re not gonna do by tweeting death threats and communist propaganda, and using words like “dialectic,” and telling everyone to read obscure European philosophers with unpronouncable names and unintelligible ideas, and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with, and expecting that people are gonna leave their jobs and comfortable lives to join a revolution to establish an economic system that’s primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship. Well that’s an unfair association. Real communism doesn’t lead to starvation and dictatorship. Has there ever been real communism? Well, yes. Between 1910 and 1912, in Revolutionary Eastern Cameroon, a thriving though short-lived communist utopia did flourish, until it was smashed by Western imperialism. Right. But what’s the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future? You seem to not even care about what’s actually possible, that’s how deep you are in pure theory. And if anything is anti-Marxist, it’s that. You know sometimes I think you secretly don’t want your ideas to succeed, you actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction. Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs then you’re never accountable for the way things are going. I’m not saying theory is everything, only that there’s no praxis without theory. Look, I’m not some kind of political scientist. For all I know you could be correct. I’m just saying, it’s a tough sell, and you are not selling it. Well, I wouldn’t have to work so hard to “sell” it if we didn’t live in a neoliberal intellectual void where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing have shifted the Overton window one inch left of fascism under the heading of “free speech” and “classical liberalism.” [knocking] Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas? [hiss] Hey, hey, hey! You leave centrists alone. Thanks Justine! Jackie, get out of here. You’re embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends. [whisper] I’ll see you at brunch. Mimosas! What the hell was that? Brunch? You go to brunch with these people? Well, it’s more of a boozy afternoon tea. Afternoon tea? Does Jeeves bring round madeleine cookies and fresh-sliced lemon wedges? No, but I do have a very nice Windsor china tea set. Unbelievable. You get the bullet too. You get the goddamn bullet too. Awww, come on. Me?? What do you want me to do, drink victory gin out of a rusty herring tin like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in Eastern Cameroon? I mean nothing is ever good enough for you people. I could be munching on a cigar in the South American Jungle shooting at capitalists with a black beret and an eye patch, and I still wouldn’t be left wing enough for you. Well why don’t you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists, and not complaining about the optics of the people who are risking their lives to keep you safe. How is Antifa keeping me safe? You do realize, don’t you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis. Most of what we do is behind the scenes organizing, infiltrating fascist groups, doxing them, disrupting their recruitment, and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist rallies. And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long enough, you’re gonna be at a counter-protest, and the black bloc is gonna save your life, because you don’t look like you can fight, and the police certainly aren’t going to save you. Well, maybe so. I mean I’m the first to admit: these are not Nazi-punching hands. So, I’m not gonna get in your way. But I can’t help but think that in the free marketplace of ideas—and like it or not, that’s what we’re in— The corporate marketplace of ideas. —what you are matters less than what you seem to be. And black-clad thugs in masks smashing things in the street seems pretty scary. Aw come on. You have to admit, there’s something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask. What about a girl in a mask? [romantic music] I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out. Well, it was worth a shot. My point is, you can’t just win the war in the street. You have to win the war in the heart and the mind. You mean the propaganda war. SHHHHH don’t call it propaganda, there could be liberals listening. Look, what the left needs to get, and what the centrists need to get, and what only I and the fascists seem to understand, is that reason doesn’t matter very much. Oh boy. Here we go. What is it that centrists hate about social justice warriors? It’s not that they don't have good reasons in support of their arguments, it’s that they’re not cool, right? Social justice warriors are not cool. What do you mean, they’re not popular? No, no, no. I mean they’re not cool. You can be unpopular and still cool. In fact it can be cool to be unpopular. So what does it mean to be cool? Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself. And the leading complaint about social justice warriors is that they’re emotional. The social justice warriors who everyone cringes at online are people, who I’m sure are nice people, but who are having a bad moment, and they’re caught on camera in the in the middle of an outburst. They’re out of control. And that’s the problem. It’s not cool. Look, this detached, ironic, pretend-not-to-give-a-shit posturing that white men mistake for rationality is really just the self-celebration of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake. People on the left are never gonna be “cool,” because anger and emotion are rational responses to injustice. I thought you’d say that. But what you’re failing to consider is that it’s possible to be both angry and cool. And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger into a glass of cool? What? You get… Ice cold. [guitar solo] I’m sorry. What? And that’s what we on the left need to become: Ice Cold Motherfuckers. [guitar solo] What the hell are you talking about? Miles Davis. Incredibly cool. But pretty angry. Did not take shit from white people. But also: ice cold motherfucker. So your plan is to win over centrists by becoming an ice cold motherfucker. Precisely. What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock n' roll. This is ridiculous. And I suppose you think this is ridiculous? I think it’s stalemate. No it’s not, my queen is wide open. No it isn’t. Take me. I’m gonna get going now. Wait, where are you going? I’m gonna go bash the fash. Well… be careful. Sure. Enjoy your tea tomorrow. What a goddamn lunatic. I’m gonna miss her. [Music: “Funeral March of a Marionette”] What ever happened to Bruce and Trixie? They got into a fight on Skype, remember? Anyway they killed each other, they’re both dead. They kind of fired guns off in random directions, it’s best not to think about it too much.\",\n",
       " 26: ' “You will not replace us! You will not replace us!” “Blood and soil! Blood and soil!” “White lives matter! White lives matter!\" “Excuse me. What about the Alt-Left that came charging at the, as you say, the Alt-Right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?” “A local World War II veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he’s worried what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the United States.” “He believes what happened—” Scheiße! Hi. In this video, I’m going to talk about How to Recognize a Fascist. [80s intro music] To begin, let’s take a look at what fascism is. Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs: 1: People of European heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural and political unity known as the white race—sometimes dog-whistled as “Western culture”. 2: Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalism and non-white immigration, a plot that fascists call “white genocide” or “ethnic replacement.” 3: The only way to save the white race is to establish a “white homeland,” or “ethnostate,” from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged. Now, as I’ve argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false. So what is it that\\'s attracting people to fascism? Well, let’s take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figure that out. “Who are you? I’m not talking about your name or your occupation, I’m talking about something bigger, something deeper. I’m talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny. Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity. They could say ‘I’m a Roman,’ ‘I’m a Saxon,’ ‘I’m a Dane.’” Good news, boys. You no longer have to be some schlubby fuck sadly riding the escalator at Ikea and thinking how much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate, because the sun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father’s claymore in hand and defend Voltaire and adorable blonde children against black civil rights, you know, just like the Vikings did! “We’re often told that being an American, or a Briton, or a German, or any European nationality is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords: democracy, freedom, tolerance, multiculturalism. But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.” So, life is basically sad, and in capitalist society, that sadness is a sense of isolation, an anxiety that there’s nothing more to life than acquiring 1990s collector’s edition Tampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim beer steins until you die. Fortunately, thanks to Fascism, you don’t have to. Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself. A homeland for your people! A sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years, and as far into the future—just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buying and selling other human beings as property. The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is. The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to the establishing a white ethnostate is just nonsense. Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever you get off to is in no way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions. And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all become the same thing. But in order to recognize fascism you need to do a lot more than reject the most overt propaganda. In the wake of the disastrous Alt-Right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month, the Nazis have been driven back into the shadows. At least two of their major websites were shut down, confederate monuments were removed all over the country, and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling. None of this means fascists will go away, it just means they’ll have to be more subtle and indirect. Shortly after the Charlottesville rally, a post titled “Fixing the Alt-Right” appeared on /pol/, the imageboard where Millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures of Japanese nymphets. The post outlines some basic fascist strategy. “Don’t get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies. Pretending that Charlottesville didn’t massively push the average white person away is really stupid. We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the Overton window to the right, but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the AVERAGE white person.” And the way to do that is: “Disavow all Nazi/KKK edgelord LARPers. There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes and holding Tiki torches while chanting ‘Jews will not replace us.’ This instantly makes the average person hate you.” “Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental overt goals. Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigration and prioritizes white immigration is an actual tangible political goal.” “Keep the long-term goals covert, and don’t ever reveal your power level. Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turning against you, so disavow anyone who reveals his power level. Leftists will recognize dog whistles and know we’re crypto, but normies won’t listen to them.” So at first glance this seems like a really silly, juvenile post that references Dragonball Z, but it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach to long-term goals that I wish were more common on the left. But of course the strategy described here isn’t new. Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades. When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language in order to appeal to racists. Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981: “You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘N—.’ By 1968, you can\\'t say ‘n—’—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states\\' rights and all that stuff. You\\'re getting so abstract now that you\\'re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\\'re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites.” So if you want to recognize a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext, and how to hear dog whistles, because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism, and white supremacy, at least when they’re talking to you, a non-fascist. Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule. Fascists are more likely to gain traction, and are hence more dangerous, when they use subtler tactics. So for the rest of this video, I’ll be describing the particular strategies that fascists use to code their ideas, and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals. Strategy 1: Outright Denial “Never reveal your power level. Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.” This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talking points, and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism should be worth absolutely nothing to you, and shouldn’t even enter into your consideration of whether they’re a fascist. After all, “I’m not a fascist” is exactly what a fascist would say. Strategy 2: Euphemism “ Of course I’m not a fascist, I’m an alternative Euro-nationalist simply trying to preserve Western values.” Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations that develop around the names of their movements whenever people figure out what they really are. So they insist they aren’t Nazis or white supremacists—just “white nationalists,” or “Alt-Right.” But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the Alt-Right are just Nazis, they’ll shift their terminology again and start telling you: “I’m not a white nationalist, I’m an identitarian.” Or whatever the next thing is. But it’s still the same bastards, they’re just using a different name. They’ll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs. If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist, they’ll talk about preserving “Western civilization” or “Western culture” instead. If the phrase “white genocide” discredits them, they’ll say “ ethnic replacement” instead. And if it’s considered hate speech to want to purge non-white people, they’ll talk instead about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists—and leave it to the audience to catch the color-coding on their own. Strategy 3: Pedantry “It’s absurd to call me a Nazi, the German National Socialist Party hasn’t existed since 1945.” That’s right, and I bet he’s an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis. Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels and also just to bog you down in a petty terminological dispute. This is a good way to waste your time and divert attention away from whatever led you to call them a Nazi in the first place. “I’m not a white supremacist, I don’t think that whites are superior to other races, I simply think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.” There it is again. And next he’s gonna tell us that since Asians have the highest IQs, he’s, if anything, an Asian supremacist. And then you’ll get sucked into arguing about IQ instead of talking about the fact that the main goal of the politics he supports is the political and social supremacy of white people over all other Americans and Europeans. In other words, white supremacy. Strategy 4: Secret Symbols Nazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the Black Sun on Fritz’s ring, or like the swastika itself, but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secret handshake that lets Nazis recognize each other, without normies taking notice. The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not generally associated with fascism, or at least have some other meaning, such as the Othala rune or the iron cross. Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous. Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod at each other, notably the frog (after pepe), the milk, and the OK sign. So it doesn’t matter what the symbols are. In fact it’s important that the symbols constantly change, so that normies don’t catch on. By the time you watch this video, they probably won’t even be using the frog anymore. Maybe it’ll be this. Or this. The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use to identify themselves. And, of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists try to point those symbols out, the fascist can always say: “ These gullible SJWs now think that even the ok sign is racist. Is there anything they don’t think is racist?” And the gullible centrists will be taken right in. The poor centrists. They’re so worried that Antifa is going to punch them because of their hair or their emoji. And, you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots, so I should say, you should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair or the emoji they use. These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle. But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at political rallies—oh god what if they profile me and attack me unfairly—that’s how a lot of black people feel about the police all the time. And the fascists whose free speech you defend so often are trying to drum up exactly the sentiments that make the police dangerous to black people, and that make it dangerous for queer people to be themselves in public. So, I hope that’s something you think about. Anyway, it’s not that the ok sign is inherently racist or that anyone who uses it is racist, and in fact it’s its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist wink and nudge. But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist sets the stage for: Strategy 5: Camaraderie of the Accused “The left accuses everyone of racism. They think all white people are Nazis. If it’s acceptable to attack and censor me, they’ll come for you next.” Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility toward “social justice warriors,” especially online. Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur’s eye for detecting fascism, and some of them do throw the accusation at centrists or liberals. This doesn’t cause centrists to become allied with fascists—history shows that happens regardless—but it can accelerate the process, lending some plausibility to the fear that moderate centrists have that anti-fascists will come after them next. It’s tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation, and use it to pump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists. Strategy 6: “Irony,” “Jokes,” “Satire,” and “Memes” “Of course I wasn’t actually being racist. It was just an edgy meme. Can’t anyone take a joke anymore, or will the Antifa fascists violently attack you over humor now too?” Here’s a uniquely Millennial twist on the racist dog-whistle. You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes, and then when called out, you mock your accuser for being a clueless normie who isn’t in on the joke. Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you’re not quite ready to own yet. Before I realized I was transgender, I used to jump at any opportunity to crossdress “ironically.” So when you see people joking about being Nazis, they could be just joking, or they could be using irony to partially conceal the truth. It’s difficult to tell the difference, and that’s the point. “But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.” Well, it’s a hilarious satire of civil rights movements that just happens to use a Nazi battle flag. And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers, who are unable or unwilling to see how helpful they’re being to fascists, Kekistan became the perfect pseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians, including the ones who led the rally where an edgy shitposter hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people. No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol. “Pff those normie fools. It’s just a joke.” Strategy 7: Shifting Blame “Why doesn’t the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations like Black Lives Matter or Antifa?” This is essentially just a tu quoque fallacy, especially heinous because of the equivocation between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence, and between white nationalism and black civil rights. The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against black people is just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing. Shortly after the Charlottesville incident, our proto-fascist president called out Antifa and the “Alt-Left,” a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists, and establish the assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the Alt-Right. Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist. “Both sides” rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them, vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists, and helps to shift the center of acceptable discourse in their direction. Strategy 8: Incrementalism “You don’t have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration. Of course I don’t support violence against the non-white people already here, but we do have a right to preserve our own boundaries and our culture, don’t we?” The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation, often aimed at representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people as a defense of white people and “white culture.” The fascist’s long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate, which at some point will require massive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another. But of course they won’t tell you about that unless they think you’re also a fascist. The strategic fascist knows it’s better to start with realistic, achievable goals, and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration, something they’ll try to get you—the centrist, conservative, or liberal—on board with by emphasizing the danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees. If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric, they can later turn that energy against the non-white people who are already here. Strategy 9: The Free-Speech Defense “You may not agree with what I say, but I have just as much a right to speak and assemble as anyone else.” Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascist’s ability to publicly recruit and intimidate, often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies, or by pressuring platforms not to host fascists. The best way for the fascist to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal value of free speech. Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silenced you are. But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity. They only value the race, the people, the nation. Their long term goal is a society where there’s no room for anyone who isn’t white, or even anyone who isn’t a fascist, to exist. So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms, but remember: you shouldn’t expect any reciprocity from them. They do not care about “diversity of opinions”—in fact they actively oppose it. That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation, and to garner sympathy from centrists. [drone] Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naïve about them: they don’t notice dog whistles, and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt. Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with children who don’t get sexual innuendo. There’s a whole hidden layer of meaning that they’re not picking up. This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easy to exploit. Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talking points without intending to or realizing it. And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense. Now you might wonder: well, if fascists disguise themselves, and liberals inadvertently duplicate fascist memes, then isn’t just about everyone suspect? Aren’t you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi? Well, that’s what they want you to think! They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid. I’ll admit there are cases where I can’t tell if someone is genuinely Alt-Light, or if they’re just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points. Likewise, it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is Alt-Light but not an outright fascist, and a fascist who’s concealing their power level. So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid. The other day the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blond child with the caption, “this is the future ACLU members want,” and for a second I was like, what the fuck? Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme. But of course it’s unintentional, it’s the ACLU. “I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. But you don’t make statements that direct unless you know the facts.” Yes, I have become crazy. But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception is the psychological consequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists and communicating in code. And it’s the intentional consequence of that. Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist’s psychological arsenal. So, how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies? I know if you’re a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists, it seems like the left all thinks you’re a Nazi and that we hate you, and I admit that I am pretty frustrated with you right now—obviously. But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better at resisting fascism. Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning, so don’t feel guilty for falling for them, just try to get better at resisting. I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this: if you care about even one person of color, or queer person, or immigrant, stand up for that person by opposing the Alt-Right and its allies. Do not give them a platform. Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel. Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech, but they do not have a right to a megaphone, and you should not be giving them one. I know to a lot of you it just seems like the free marketplace of ideas, everyone expressing their ideas peacefully. But to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous, because if those ideas catch on, their lives are at stake. Now if you’re just an average person without a big platform, then you actually can debate, and you should be debating. Argue with your friends who are getting kinda Alt-Righty. Argue with your family, argue with your coworkers. Let them know that you don’t agree. Make them listen to a different perspective. And if you’re someone who’s gotten involved with the Alt-Right in the last couple years and is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group, you have to get out now. It is not too late. Society will forgive you. If you don’t know how to leave, look up Life After Hate, an organization founded by a former neo-Nazi that helps people get out of hate groups. And as for all you lefties: na zdrowie! Keep up the good fight, comrades. [Star-Spangled Banner] [synthwave] [mysterious piano music]'}"

      " (light classical music) - Hello again, the gays! Welcome to my garden party fantasy. Straight people are of course welcome to tag along too, provided you're emotionally damaged. Hi! Hey how are you! Cringe! Let's talk about it! The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately. It just pops into my head all the time. Like when I randomly remember that month back in 2013 when all my Facebook posts were just lyrics to Kesha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter? Why? What audience was that for? Who is this inconceivable person I used to be? Cringe! Megacringe! I think I say this word like 50 times a day, cringe cringe cringe. And I'm not the only one. Google Trends shows that in the US search interest in the word cringe has dramatically increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since. And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe is at an all-time high the month I'm making this video. So what is cringe? Well, let's start with some examples. There was a recent thread on AskReddit titled \"What Things Really Make You Cringe?\" And here's some of the most upvoted responses, \"The time I was talking too loud at a wedding \"when I wasn't supposed to and everyone \"at the wedding turned around to see \"what asshole wouldn't shut up.\" \"Recordings of my own voice.\" \"When I remember that I did the 'I do have a boyfriend, 'he just goes to another school' thing\" \"Early teen me. \"So many cringe stuff I did. \"I hope all of my old friends have forgotten about me\" \"This happened about two years ago. \"I ordered some Pizza Hut online \"and when it was delivered, \"the lady handed me the pizza boxes. \"I said thanks and she told me my shirt was inside out. \"I said oh, and then she hands me the receipt \"to sign and leave a tip, and I spend 30 seconds \"trying to get the pen to work. \"She looks at the pen and says 'you have to click the pen.' \"I said oh, and then she reaches \"to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good. \"Then I said 'you too' and then I closed the door \"and killed myself.\" All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl says in her book \"Cringeworthy: A Theory of Awkwardness.\" According to Dahl, \"The moments that make us cringe are when we're yanked out \"of our own perspective, and we can suddenly \"see ourselves from somebody else's point of view.\" She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who in the '60s did a study of the Biami tribe in New Guinea where he showed them mirror, video, and photographic images of themselves for the first time, and described the results: \"They were paralyzed: after their first startled \"response, covering their mouths and ducking \"their heads, they stood transfixed, \"staring at their images, \"only their stomach muscles betraying great tension.\" So basically, they cringed at themselves. Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing. Like, pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice when they hear a recording for the first time, I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating in your head. So when you hear the recording you realize oh God, that's how other people hear me all the time. And you're suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear to yourself, and the way you appear to other people. That's when you cringe, that feeling Dahl describes as \"The intense visceral reaction produced \"by an awkward moment, an unpleasant kind \"of self-recognition where you suddenly \"see yourself through someone else's eyes. \"It's a forced moment of self-awareness, \"and it usually makes you cognizant \"of the disappointing fact \"that you aren't measuring up to your own self-concept.\" When you're talking too loud at a wedding and suddenly everyone turns around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up, you suddenly realize how you look to them, because we've all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up. But this time, you're the asshole. Cringe! Oftentimes, it's the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe. There's no law of state or even of etiquette that tells you exactly how loud to speak at a wedding. It's something you have to intuit based on context: how loud are other people speaking? Is the ceremony about to begin and we're all supposed to be quiet now? According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael Here, the function of awkwardness is that-- - It sands social dynamics by smoothing out even what etiquette doesn't rule on. - Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward. It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego. And memories of your cringey moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves. 10 years later you'll be trying to fall asleep and for no reason at all your brain will decide to remind you of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding, and of the stupid thing you were saying when everyone turned around, and you'll cringe all over again. That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful, 'cause you look back and you realize, damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years. Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don't know, November? All the examples we've considered so far involve self-cringe, but usually when we talk about cringe on the Internet, we're talking about cringing at other people. Popular subreddits like r/cringe, cringepics, and Cringetopia host videos and images of people behaving in cringey ways, for instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis, grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry, and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter with black people. - Who let the dogs out? Who, who? - Ugh watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire. It makes me wanna crawl out of my body and escape into another dimension. I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others. For me it's uncomfortable to the point where I'll reflexively pause a video like that because I just can't stand it. In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube videos, which sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room. So why is it that cringing at other people hurts the same way as cringing at yourself? Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment, or second-hand embarrassment. Basically, it's a form of empathy. When you cringe at someone, you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling, just as if you see someone fall down the stairs you might wince empathetically with their pain. But there's a problem with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe, or at least a complication. Which is that in the purest examples of cringe, the person doing the cringey thing isn't feeling embarrassed. In fact, often they're super confident, and it's actually their lack of self-awareness about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe. Like when a woman posts a ridiculously over-Facetuned picture of herself as if anyone's going to believe she looks like that, or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus. So in the Internet sense of the word, cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment. Someone tripping and falling onstage is embarrassing, and I do feel embarrassed for her. But she knows it's embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed. - You guys are just standing up 'cause I fell and that's really embarrassing but thank you. - Nothing about this is cringe. Maybe to her, it's self-cringe. Maybe she looks back on it and it's still embarrassing. But I don't cringe at her. Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone and cringing with them. When someone falls on stage I cringe with her, in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment; my feelings mirror what she's feeling. But when I'm cringing at someone, I'm feeling something very different to what they're feeling. I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself. Another example is bad American Idol auditions, which are quintessential cringe content. People try out for American Idol because they think they're good enough singers to compete in a national competition. So they're effectively revealing their own delusions when they show up and sing like this. ♪ Is this the real life ♪ ♪ Or is this just fantasy ♪ - It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe. Most of us are bad singers, right, when people sing Happy Birthday at a party, usually they're singing in three different keys at no particular tempo. But that's not cringe because the point of singing Happy Birthday is not to sound amazing. Bad American Idol auditions are cringe because of the contestants' misplaced confidence. - Who are you as good as in your opinion? - The lead singer from Queen. - It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog. (singing out of tune) I admit that watching Red, I'm actually not in very much pain when I'm cringing at him. I laugh at his ludicrous performance, just like the judges do. And, because he's so cocky, and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself, there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure. There's almost a sense of karma, a sense that because of his tragic hubris, he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself. And my sense that he deserves it suppresses my compassionate response, and it helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation. Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant, Meesha, who's there with her mom, and they both seem like such sweethearts. - I do believe in her talent very much. - And yeah she's delusional about her singing talent, but I'm routing for her, and when she embarrasses herself I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe. ♪ Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me ♪ - Yikes. My differing reactions to Red and Meesha track a distinction that Dahl makes between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe. Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification with the person you're cringing at. Even if they aren't actually embarrassed themselves in the cringeworthy moment, you still feel the embarrassment they would feel or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware of how other people are perceiving them. Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand, involves an emotional distancing from the person you're cringing at. Just like with compassionate cringe, you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves, but instead of feeling that embarrassment on their behalf, you feel annoyance and disgust at them, and maybe even a little schadenfreude. So these are actually two very different emotional responses, vicarious embarrassment versus contempt. But we call both feelings cringe, not because they're similar feelings, but because they're responses to the same type of situation: people lacking self-awareness embarrassing themselves without realizing it. Now, embarrassment and contempt, seem, at face value, like pretty unpleasant feelings. So why are we so fascinated by content that makes us feel that way? Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members? Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos so popular on YouTube? Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations? Well I think the answer to that question depends on whether we're cringing compassionately or contemptuously. When I read that AskReddit thread, where all the people share their cringe stories, I cringe compassionately, that is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them. And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with them. I recognize myself in them, and I'm reassured to hear that other people are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am. I'm not the only one who cringes at my past, or at videos of myself; I'm not the only who's says \"You too\", when the person says the pizza smells good. When we collectively laugh at these situations, we're bonding over our shared human frailty. We're recognizing that we all say the wrong thing sometimes. That we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion, only to later educate ourselves and realize how ignorant and wrong we were. That we've all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable, as beautiful, and talented, and badass; only to totally miss the mark and completely embarrass ourselves. And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses; it makes us feel less alone. Now, this is all of course assuming that we're cringing compassionately. But I would argue that most cringe content on the Internet does not encourage compassion. And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact, because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved. This is the 21st century, right? Pillories and freakshows and public floggings, these are barbaric practices from the Dark Ages, right? Surely no one the Internet would ever entertain themselves by humiliating people, right? (frantic circus music) We've got maniacs, we've got wackadoos, we've got schizos, fatties, and spergs! Come see sexual deviants on display! That's right folks, we've got cackling perverts of every denomination! Come see the panty-sniffer, he'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings! Come see the skeleton girl, she hasn't had a bite in 30 days! That's right we've got real live lesbians! I'll be your master of ceremonies: half man, half woman, all freak. Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish, welcome to the dark side of cringe. Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture. And by that I mean there's whole channels making content that centers the experience of cringing, and there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content, which includes content the creator doesn't intend to be cringe. I first started paying attention to this back in 2016, which was the heyday of the feminist cringe compilation or the SJW cringe compilation. Remember those? This is all ancient history by YouTube standards but in 2106, the word cringe was most associated with a teenage YouTuber called LeafyIsHere. His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video, which means he would play someone else's content, then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is. ♪ No makeup with some sweatpants ♪ - [Man] Oh my God. It's so f*cking bad. He looks like he's genderfluid. He looks like a f*cking lesbian. - This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential, and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts and freethinking tuxedos. - [Man] What even is this thing? It must be one of the 76 genders. I didn't realize retarded was a gender. - I'm sorry my dudes, you were on the cringe side of history. Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos. The logical antelope isn't inviting you to foster a shared sense of humanity by recognizing your own weakness in the embarrassment of screeching feminists. No. This is an invitation to contempt. Here's a YouTube video titled \"Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.\" You'd expect from the title that it would be a video of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways. But it isn't. It's literally just a compilation of fat people doing things. This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming. Is this cringe? What is cringe about it? Earlier we defined cringe as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt for someone who lacks self-awareness about the way others are perceiving them. But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there's no context, so we don't know anything about her mental state. And we certainly don't know whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived. If there was an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel, or if she tried to Photoshop herself to look like a size four, okay, maybe that would be cringe. But that's not what's going on in this clip. She's just existing, in water. What cringe are we being invited to feel over this? Presumably, something along the lines of \"Ew, fat people. \"Gross.\" It's literally just disgust, right? Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body. Here's another cringe compilation, this one titled \"Genderfluid Non-Binary Cringe\" and we're watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their genderfluid identity - Honestly it's kind of terrifying because genderfluid people just aren't as accepted. - Yeah apparently not. And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this in a cringe compilation, it seems the person in the video was dead on about how other people will perceive them. But despite that self-awareness, we're being invited to cringe. Because I guess being genderfluid, like being fat, is cringe in and of itself. Now, the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe. This isn't real cringe, I want to say, cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others. But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread that there's really no point in objecting to it. If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia, one of the sleazier cringe subreddits, you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow, a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper. These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts. They're types of people who are widely ridiculed online. I'd like to share with you a list that I've put together of groups that are often considered to be cringe, Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels, neckbeards, fedora-tippers, gamers, TikTok teens, not-like-other-girls girls, fanfic writers, beat poets, SJWs, feminists, MAGAs, trans people, non-binary people, transtrenders, queer AFAB ukulele players, autistic people, fat people, the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled. Now I'm searching for some thread that all these groups have in common. And a handful of themes do jump out: Deviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual. A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism. The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure. Obsessive interests in unconventional hobbies. Low social status. It's pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days. If you add up all the groups on this list, I bet it includes most of the people watching this video. It includes me three or four times. I'm, of course, a fedora-tipping, queer, AFAB ukulele-playing, TikTok teen. Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe and try to be like compassionate or whatever? (scoffing) F*ck no. The Internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullsh*t. Oh no, this is social reject \"Battle Royale.\" Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way, and I want to explore what the rewards might be. Let's start by looking at the role of cringe in Internet politics, where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy. At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so, you couldn't escape clips of this woman known as Big Red, a Toronto resident who showed up at a Men's Rights event and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely. - It's part of patriarchy. Part of patriarchy. I don't know if you're noticing a theme: Patriarchy. I'm reading, f*ckface. Mr. Entitled. Mr. Ego. Patriarchy f*ckface! - She's one of these people who generates memeable phrases at an amazing rate. I actually think she's hilarious and iconic, but, I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia. Anyway this video appeared in countless cringe compilations, reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays. Often Big Red was framed as like THE feminist, the mascot of feminism, a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists. Which is highly dishonest, considering she's not even a high-profile activist or thinker. She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto. But because of this amusing 12-minute video, it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman, who, we we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form. I call this strategy mascotization, the construction of a strawman nemesis. What you do is you select a cringeworthy person and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team. It's very simple, but very effective. And it's best paired with memeification; that's when you take a single moment in a person's life, you freeze it, and you declare that that moment fully represents a person. Then, through mascotization, you declare that this memeified person represents an entire group or movement. Other right-wing memes from this era include this protestor. - You're a f*cking white male. - Memeified as AIDS Skrillex. And this protestor. - Get your hate speech off this campus. Get your hate speech off this campus. - Who was memeified as Trigglypuff. The two of them symbolized the wretchedness of beta numale cuckoldry, and the hysteria of social justice crybullies, respectively. I guess the ultimate memeified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian, about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded. Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe, as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb-tier casual throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers. Other times it was almost a super-villainous caricature, this sort of dark devouring mother archetype, threatening to confiscate your video games and engulf you in her yonic abyss. Now it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as supervillains is effective. Though it comes at the risk of backfiring by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful, a little too bad-ass. But the subtler strategy of symbolizing your political enemies with not an evil but a cringeworthy mascot works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense emotional way. Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule and if someone has been made a laughing stock, it's much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing than it is to risk being laughed at yourself. To be cringe is to not be in on the joke. And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection, I think one reason we're fascinated by cringe content is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at. When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online, laughing at someone and ridiculing them, we register an emotional memory of it as a warning: don't act like that, or people will laugh at you. This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior. It's why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals. You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory, at the whipping post; you see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables. And it sends a powerful message. Don't do what that guy did. I don't think the Internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it's the 17th Century. There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks, but instead, there's teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos; there's ex-boyfriends revenge-posting their girlfriend's nudes; there's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone for alleged breaches of wokeness. Public humiliation is a powerful force, and it's usually uh, it's not a good force. But there are some rare exceptions. Back in the Gamergate era-Gamegate itself of course being a study in public humiliation, slut-shaming on a massive online scale- YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism. As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks, and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers who were constantly mobbed and harassed. What I see as one of the turning points in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days to the LeftTube world of today was a handful of videos uploaded by the then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis, in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual called Davis Aurini. - Come on Davis, no stop lecturing me about ethics we have to get out of here, and can you please stop trying to start a forest fire! - [Natalie] In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women, while posing in front a toy skull and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey. - Men of the West, women in our culture have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome. And so in discussing sluts versus whores, I would start with the premise that all women are whores. - Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views and a fairly positive response even from a mostly male gamer audience, who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time. Why did these videos work with this audience, where so many others didn't? Well, I think it's because Harry didn't moralistically call out Davis for being problematic or misogynistic. Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact that Davis is a cringeworthy buffoon. And Davis was a perfect target because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense; he had no self-awareness about the fact that pretty much everyone saw through his absurd posturing as a badass tough guy by day, profoundly dark philosopher by night. - We exist in a world with feminized legislation. - I've spoken to men and boys, who've told me that Harry's videos inspired the beginnings of a feminist awakening in them, not just because they cringed at Davis Aurini, but also because they recognized a little bit of Davis in themselves, and they cringed at that too. Recognizing part of yourself in a cringeworthy person induces self-cringe, which can motivate you to change your behavior, your beliefs, or even your own self-concept. And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance of a recognizable stock character on the Internet, namely the fedora-tipper. Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader for traditional masculinity, but who's basically just a pasty nerd who can't relate to women. Davis was such an extreme version of this, and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments so frequently that I would classify him as what the Internet calls a lolcow. Lolcow is old 4chan lingo, it means a person whose unintentionally eccentric or foolish behavior can be milked for lols. Milking in this context can mean simply watching the lolcow's behavior and laughing at them, or it can mean making reaction videos where you make fun of them, or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them to get a response that you find entertaining. I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis, or my old videos about The Golden One as lolcow-milking content, with a political angle. It was essentially an argument from ridicule, an argument from cringe, with the aim of convincing people: don't embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs. But also, and I'll just speak for myself here, I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer. And I wanted people to laugh. There doesn't need to be a political agenda behind milking lolcows, in fact usually there isn't. The purest example of a lolcow I can think of is actually someone from way before the Internet, namely Florence Foster Jenkins. Jenkins, or Lady Florence as she liked to be called, was an American soprano who attracted a cult following in New York City during the 1920s, '30s and '40s due to her being such a terrible singer that people went to her concerts essentially for the lols. She was described as \"The world's worst opera singer. \"No one, before or since, \"has succeeded in liberating themselves quite \"so completely from the shackles of musical notation.\" Behold this f*cking camp queen. Oh we have no choice but to stan. Here's a short clip of one of the few recordings she made. (bird squawking) Cringe. So she was essentially the Tommy Wiseau, the William Hung of her age. Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence, until 1944, when she was 76 years old, and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert, to which newspaper critics showed up. The next morning, the New York Sun reported, \"Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking \"in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note \"was from its proper elevation the more \"the audience laughed and applauded.\" And five days later she had heart attack and died. I find something very touching about this story. I mean I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone if I were at Carnegie Hall that night, but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence. It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell; at least he tries to stop these people before things get out of hand. I think it's normal to have mixed feelings about a lolcow. Like yes this is hilarious but on the other hand, doth not a lolcow bleed? On some level we know it's wrong to entertain ourselves this way, but on the other hand, other people's pain is incredibly entertaining. There's a good book about this called \"The Joy of Pain: Schadenfreude and the Dark Side \"of Human Nature by Richard Smith.\" Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take in other people's misery, and Smith argues that we experience it because psychologically we gain something when other people lose. We're constantly evaluating our own worth by comparing ourselves to other people. So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost, a pleasant feeling of superiority from comparing ourselves to people beneath us, especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with. Maybe I'm not perfect, but at least I'm not this lolcow. And we also get a boost when people who are socially above us, whom we envy, get brought down a peg. James Charles is canceled party, lolol. I think schadenfreude basically accounts for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com. Smith uses the word humilitainment for this type of media, like reality TV shows designed to produce spectacular moments of embarrassment. YouTube is basically a big reality TV show, or some kind of a carnival sideshow. I mean, take a look around you. We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who at the time I'm making this video remains apparently in total denial about her eating disorder, and continues to make videos modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers. We have WingsOfRedemption, a bad-tempered gamer who for a long time was essentially confined by poverty, obesity, and depression to streaming video games all day to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him. We have Onision, a habitual, alleged, abuser of women and teenage girls who earlier this year essentially performed his own mental breakdown on YouTube after Patreon banned him for doxxing an accuser. - I love kombucha. Whooo, whooo! - Whose idea was it to give hundreds of pathological narcissists access to video equipment? What kind of sick social experiment are we living in? And the viewers are no better than the performers. Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick. Oh, you people love nothing more than to watch one of us poor helpless egomaniacs completely lose our minds live on camera. - Is this what you want, huh? Is this what, you want a total meltdown! - You know as a creator you have to be aware that you're a circus performer, and the crowd may in fact be more entertained if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers. Online media today is full of Lady Florences, anti-celebrities with anti-fans. Now, to be clear, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with indulging now and then in a little bit of light contempt. Cringing at Davis Aurini or bad American Idol auditions seems pretty harmless, but it can be taken too far. And there's no better case study of taking it too far than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler. If you don't know what's coming, you might wanna strap in gorg, cause this is coconuts, it's bananas, it's a full fruit salad. God how do I even begin to explain this? Well, Christine Weston Chandler, more commonly known on the Internet as Chris-Chan, is the victim of what is quite possibly the longest running and most obsessive Internet trolling saga of all time. She's the lolcow of lolcows. - Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler. coming to you live from home once again. - Chandler is an autistic trans woman, and yes I will be calling her by she/her pronouns, which I pause to explain because I don't think I've ever seen anyone actually take her transition seriously. Most people seem to regard it as simply another absurd symptom of her hilarious mental condition. In fact a bunch of trans people will probably get real salty with me for making trans people look bad by including Chris-Chan in our, oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club. Oh please. Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty; this is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society. God, how did tr@nnies get so snobbish? Look is Chris-Chan really trans? I don't know, and I don't care. If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman, I for one support her journey. But it doesn't matter. The relevant thing about Chris-Chan is not Chris-Chan. It's the fact that for the last 13 years, nearly every aspect of her life has been obsessively archived online by thousands of voyeurs known as Christorians. Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom several Internet centuries ago, back in 2007, when 4chan took notice of her comic-book series Sonichu, a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu. The comic is set in CWCville, CWC being Chris-Chan's initials. The protagonist is a self-insert who references Chandler's real-life quote \"Love Quest\" to find a quote, \"Boyfriend-free girl,\" which apparently involved posting bizarre \"attraction signs\" around her community college. For this story to make sense you have to keep in mind that Chandler identified and presented as male until 2015, so these trolls saw her as like the ultimate autistic incel manchild. Just to give you a feel for this person, here is Christine in 2018 holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait, note the Sonichu medallions, here is the bedroom she lived in, and here she is in recent years giving us a full bronycon eleganza. Pegasister snapped. Basically she's the entire Cringetopia subreddit condensed into a single person. So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit, because of course they did, and they began tormenting her by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu, posting candid photos of her, et cetera. Chandler reacted to the trolls, which of course encouraged them more, and the harassment escalated and escalated. They hacked her accounts, or tricked her into giving out passwords, they posted all her emails online. They showed up in person and photographed her house. They called her parents posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers in order to extract as much information about her as possible. And of course they contacted Chandler herself, which was very rewarding for trolls, because she has no filter, and was very naive and trusting. So she was very willing to divulge, or was easily manipulated into divulging, mortifying information about herself, sexual, psychological, scatological, there's not really any limits or boundaries to this. For all the information they gathered, the trolls created a Wiki, called the CWCki, devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris-Chan data. It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom, entire articles about all members of her immediate and extended family, pages of psychiatric records she was tricked into sending them, and that's only the beginning. In their more grandiose moods, the Christorians have speculated that Chris-Chan is the most documented life in all human history, comparing their social experitainment to \"The Truman Show.\" It's a level of obsession that surpasses the wildest excesses of stan culture. It is a gaze into the abyss that does not blink. Some trolls have also sent taunting letters and packages, or on one occasion sex workers to the Chandler household. Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates with Chris-Chan, of course secretly wearing wires to record their conversations. Others pretended to be her Internet girlfriends so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos. These things must be archived don't you understand? Chris-Chan must be documented. The absolute low point came when some trolls encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl and have phone sex with Chris-Chan and record it. In other words, they groomed a child to deceive an autistic person into performing sex acts for their entertainment. Now to contemporary Christorians this sort of sadistic interference with Christine's life is frowned upon, not so much because it's immoral so much as because it's considered a bit tacky, a bit attention seeking. No, to the sophisticated Christorian the real pleasure of all this is supposed to lie in quietly spectating, savoring the fine notes of cringe. Now I take it I don't even need to comment on the morality of all this. The real question to me is why. Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession with Christine Chandler? And yes it is an obsession. Just to give a sense of a single individual's personal investment in this, the YouTuber Geno Samuel, one of very few Christorians with the audacity to show his face, has been working for more than two years to produce an eventual-100-episode documentary series about the life of Chris-Chan. Geno has completed 36 episodes so far, and each episode is around 40 minutes long, meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video about the life of what is essentially a random stranger. I think this phenomenon deserves its own name. I'll call it morbid cringe: defined as an obsessive and addictive contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group. Why does morbid cringe happen? Well, I've spent some time poring over Christorians' conversations with each other, and I've even interrogated a couple of them, and this is what I've found. The first thing they'll tell you is they just think it's funny and entertaining, that Christine's strange life and mind simply appeals to their morbid curiosity. And I'm sure that's true. But a lot of things are funny and entertaining and morbidly interesting. Why fixate on this particular person? Well, for a lot of them it's a reassurance that there's someone out there worse than them. Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills, but at least this defenseless punching bag called Chris-Chan is here for them to assert their superiority over. It's pretty much common knowledge that a lot of Christorians, including some of the most vocal haters, are autistic themselves. And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris-Chan is that she's, \"Giving autistics a bad name.\" In recent years there's also been a small contingent of transgender trolls, who are likewise prone to say, \"He's not a real transgender like me \"and he's making us all look bad.\" Oh, yeah, because people who troll Chris-Chan, you guys look amazing. It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this about why trolling Chandler is justified, righteous even. Because at the end of the day, trolls are people too, and a lot of them actually do have a guilty conscience about this, which they suppress by insisting that Chris-Chan is a horrible person who deserves to be tormented. But trolls who protest-too-much about the evils of Chris-Chan, and therefore reveal the excess of their emotional investment in this, are known in the community as A-Logs. A-Log was a troll who attracted the ire of other trolls by ranting about about Chris-Chan's crimes, comparing her to Hitler, and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession. Among the trolls this kind of behavior is considered an embarrassment to all of them, because they want to feel like they're just coolly and casually toying with this person; you know, just for laughs, not a big deal, this is all perfectly healthy and normal and fine. It's fine. But A-Log gave the lie to that illusion, because it was obvious that his Chris-Chan obsession wasn't healthy or normal or fine. So the other trolls turned on A-Log and they made him into Chris-Chan 2.0, and they uncovered his autism and his furry porn collection and his cringey erotic fanfiction. So why would someone as similar to Chris-Chan as A-Log obsessively hate on her? Well there's two explanations. One is trollshielding, that is A-Log may have performatively despised Chris-Chan and spearheaded the trolling efforts in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls. The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob by waving your pitchfork the hardest. Obviously this did not work. The other other explanation is that A-Log saw himself reflected in Chris-Chan, and sort of projected his own shame and self-contempt onto her. A-Log hated Chris-Chan because he saw part of himself in her. And the other trolls hated A-Log because they saw part of themselves in him. To quote Margaret Pless, who covered this story in New York Magazine a few years ago, \"I think it might be A-Logs all the way down.\" People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-Chan because to them she's a symbol of something they hate about themselves; something they're ashamed of. Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum, or being a socially awkward recluse, maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents, or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons, or embarrassing sexual proclivities. Or all of the above. This is how scapegoating works, right, you repress your uncomfortable feelings of shame and insecurity and self-loathing, and you displace them onto someone else, usually someone you can feel superior to. Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat, transforming your painful shame and self-loathing into pleasant judgmental self-righteousness. It's pretty safe to assume that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris-Chan. So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris-Chan is a way of processing the shame and anxiety of social rejection and exclusion. And I think for a lot of people, even normal people who aren't part of a bizarre Internet stalker community, contemptuous cringing helps us cope with our own shame and insecurity. Anyway it's time to stop this tedious empathizing with other people and find a way to make this all about me. (light orchestral music) (music box playing \"Danse Macabre\") (shushing) Meow meow. Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend? Would you like to meet my boyfriend's boyfriend? That's right, henny, I'm giving you fujoshi realness nyaa. He's gonna stay right here as a grim reminder of the things that you have seen. Actually, I identify as a trap. It's very that. I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe. Cringe is failed seriousness. In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am of being a transgender lesbian. Cringe. Shame! At the end of that video I talk about how I sense that my shame is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel for a lot of other trans lesbians, particularly those of the heckin stripey-sock nya nya catgirl variety. But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians. I want to return to that thought, and kind of psychoanalyze myself as a kind of first-person case study of a morbid cringe obsession. So, catgirl trans girls are, I can't believe I'm about to explain this. They're trans women, usually attracted to women, who express their identity online through cloying, neotenous otaku memery. And my conscious reason for cringing at them is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls as a kind of visual baby-talk, an infantilized and unrealistic representation of femininity and womanhood that's designed to titillate nerdy boys. So when trans women identify with it, I cringe. Like, no, you can't become an anime girl, Lily. F*ck your dreams. Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked with a discussion of whether my opinions about catgirls are fair or correct. So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls. Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls. Listen to the contempt beneath my words. Because even if everything I'm saying is true, \"Catgirls are being cringe online\" is a situation so inconsequential, that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much. So why do I have this cringe fixation? Well according to the A-Log Theory of Morbid Cringing, we form obsessive and addictive contempt for people who have traits in common with us; people who make us uncomfortable because we see something of ourselves in them. So do I have traits in common with the catgirls? Well, we're both trans women. We're both attracted to women. Um, I do like anime, but, I don't like the anime they like, okay? I like good anime that has mature, three-dimensional female characters, look I'm a real transgender okay I'm not like you! It's not lost on me that this is like the seventh time on this channel, I've dressed as a catgirl, \"to make fun of them.\" (scoffing) I have posted cringe, and you should all be laughing at me right now. Nyanyanyanyanyanya! So I do think there's some truth to the idea that I'm A-Logging these catgirls. I also think there's a group representation aspect to this, like I'm afraid that other people will cringe at a group that includes me, trans lesbians, because of how these catgirls are acting. So, let's make yet another distinction between ingroup cringe and outgroup cringe. Ingroup cringe is when you cringe at someone who belongs to the same group identity as you, for example your family, your romantic partnership, your ethnicity, or your country. Particularly if they're embarrassing themselves in front of outsiders to the group. Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends. Or, think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump being our president. Or, think about the phrases, \"She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber\", \"They're making trans people look bad\", \"He's giving autistics a bad name.\" When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group, we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment, we feel embarrassment, because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too. So ingroup cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe, because you're cringing at your membership in an embarrassing group. Nothing has ever triggered this kind of ingroup embarrassment more for me than a cringe video that went viral last year in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum over being misgendered in a GameStop. - [Woman] You're gonna give me my f*cking money back. - [Woman] Excuse me, sir, there's a young man here. You need to watch your mouth. - Excuse me, it's ma'am. It is ma'am. - This video is excruciating for me to watch. - Motherf*cker, take it outside. If you wanna call me sir again, I will show you a f*cking sir. - [Man] I apologize. - [Woman] Motherf*cker. - [Man] I apologize, ma'am. (grunting) - The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly intimidate people into seeing you as a woman. (grunting) Now Twitter's gonna come for me over this and say \"Natalie hates trans women who don't pass.\" But passing is really not what this is about. It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior from a trans woman, accompanied by apparently total delusion about how she's presenting. - Well I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I am not. - It's really not that clear, gorg. And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right, the incongruity between her thinking that she's serving woman while bellowing like a drill sergeant. By the way, what I'm doing right now, this is cringe reaction content. I don't really do that on this channel, but I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels. And it feels good. Like, intoxicatingly good. I can see how you could get addicted to this. I'm imagining myself right now surrounded by cis people and I'm leading the righteous mob as we all point and laugh at some delusional manly dump truck. I am a real transgender, a true transgender, a good transgender, father finally approves of me! Uh, this would be the unconscious archetypal father. Jot that down in my progress notes please, Doctor. Okay so why does this feel so good? Well, let me talk you through my feelings. When I watch that GameStop video, for first few seconds, I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her. I can even relate, because in the first couple months of my transition, there was an occasion where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction where the guy at the desk was calling me sir the entire time. And there's something very humiliating about trying to present female, like wearing a dress and makeup, and yet being called sir. It's a quintessential mismatch between self-concept and the way other people are seeing you. And the memory of it is painful to me, but what I cling to is that while I may have looked like man, at least I didn't act like a man. I didn't threaten to take anyone outside and \"Show them a sir.\" In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy. So as the GameStop video progresses, my sympathy runs out fast. And instead of compassionate cringe, I feel group embarrassment for trans women including myself, and I feel contempt towards this individual for making us all look bad. I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear: what if I'm as delusional as this trans woman? I don't look and sound like that, do I? I feel like I have to do a sanity check. I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror, listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure. That fear motivates me to distance myself from the person in the video. I don't feel compassion for her because that would mean putting myself in her size 16 shoes. And I don't want to do that because I'm horrified and repulsed by the thought that I'm like her in some way. So I want to push away, and contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself. And if I express that contempt by publicly shaming and condemning her, then I'm also socially distancing myself. Accidental Covid jokes. Oops, guess it's uh, contagious. (crowd booing) I think many people who are stigmatized, or who have been humiliated, long for the experience of being a normal, surrounded by fellow normals, judging and humiliating a freak. And if you take a look around trans YouTube, a lot of the biggest creators on the platform have channels that are basically devoted to exactly this type of cringe-reaction humilitainment. The YouTuber Kalvin Garrah is a trans guy who is best known for what are essentially cringe reaction videos, mostly aimed at people he deems transtrenders. That is, people who claim to be trans but who aren't real transgenders like Kalvin. He's especially bothered by girly AFAB trans and non-binary teenagers, or by anyone who muddies the line between trans-masculine and lesbian identities. Sometimes he'll do a long form reaction to a specific person who grinds his gears. - So this person is an asexual, non-binary, transgender lesbian, who uses he/they/its/thons pronouns. According to my calculation, you are a transtrender. - [Natalie] And other times he'll basically just laugh at cringey trans TikTok teens. (laughing) - No, no, I'm turning off the video. I can't watch this. - He has a couple justifications for making these videos. One is that he's actually helping the people he's cringing at, because if a trender transitions, then they'll give themselves dysphoria and they'll have to detransition. But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people really help them figure out whether they're trans or not? His other justification is that transtrenders are giving real trans people a bad name; they're the reason people are transphobic, this is why they hates us. It's because of the trenders. Wow, I love the idea of a truscum furry. Isn't that just, isn't that just wonderful? A truscum furry! But it's not though. Transphobia existed long before there were people you could plausibly describe as transtrenders. So transtrenders are not the reason society hates trans people, Kalvin. They're the reason you hate trans people, right? Or at least the trans community. And I feel like what you're doing is you're projecting that feeling onto society at large and saying oh this is the reason people are transphobic. And to be fair I get that it's not just a projection. Back in 2016, the SJW cringe era, it was cis people mocking trans people with all these tropes: attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders, special snowflakes. But now they're used by trans people trying to distance themselves, trying to ghettoize the most laughed at people in the community under the label of transtrenders. And Kalvin there may be some truth to what you're saying about there being confused teenagers who think they're trans when they're not; I mean I wouldn't know cause I'm a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life. I don't hang out with teenagers, But if even it is true, Kalvin, your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me. Like, you return to this topic to cringe again and again and again and again and again, it's like you're picking at a wound. It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession, and I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you. This could be me projecting of course but, I wonder if the way you feel about girly sparklegender AFABs is similar to the way I feel about otaku transbian catgirls. And it might be worth considering that I don't cringe at the sparklegenders the way you do. I mean I'm with on you on wondering what a he/they/xir genderflux lesbian demiboy is, but unlike you, Kalvin, I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession with feminine AFAB trans people. They can identify as however many genders they want for all I care. I may not always understand it, but I support their journey. I guess it doesn't bother me because I'm not worried that anyone will judge me because of how they behave. I don't feel ingroup cringe. Now, it's a different story if I'm reading a general lesbian subreddit and I see a comment like: \"Pre-transition trans lesbian here. \"I wish I had titties. \"Girldick nya nya!\" Get the f*ck out of here, Lily! You're giving real trans lesbians a bad name! This is why they hate us! See now I have strong feelings. Now I'm ingroup cringing. And intellectually, I do think think my feelings are correct to some extent. Like I don't think a general lesbian community is the appropriate forum for a trans woman who's effectively still living as a man to take the mic and whine about wanting titties or rhapsodize about girldick. But I'm also aware that I feel this strongly about this because of my own dysphoria, and my own shame, and, honestly, my self-loathing. Like, I can't even talk to cis women on dating apps, because I feel like a fake woman imposing myself on real women. That's where my head is at. So, where does this pre-transition trans lesbian get the audacity! You know it makes me feel ingroup cringe about an identity, trans lesbianism, which for me is already a pain point of insecurity, embarrassment, and shame. So Kalvin maybe, and again I could just be projecting, but maybe that's kind of like how you feel about these trenders. When you make videos condemning them as not really trans, aren't you essentially exiling them from the ingroup, so that you no longer feel the pain of ingroup cringe? Or perhaps, Kalvin Garrah, what you're really trying to destroy is the trender within. (bell ringing) And again I could be full of sh!t here. At the end of the day this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven't met. So feel free to tell me if I'm full of sh!t Kalvin, but still, I guess I invite you to consider whether producing transtrender humilitainment is actually helping anything, or whether it's just an addictive way to scratch some kind of emotional itch. All right, I've said my piece about Kalvin. Who's next? Oh how about, Vanessa. We meet again, gorg. And once again, I'm wearing some kind of embarrassing anime hairpiece. Vanessa is a trans woman who is, the second most popular political trans YouTuber. At least that's what I wrote in the script when I had more subscribers than her and was fully prepared to be a c*nt about it, but since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again. Good for her. Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel back when SJW cringe was fashionable. She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs but the most consistent theme was transtrenders and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name, they're making us look bad, this why people hate us. So what we can now recognize as a standard ingroup cringe fixation. But Vanessa focused in particular on a strident SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis. And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her where she made a point of misgendering Riley, and dismissing her as a fake transgender who hadn't transitioned and clearly had no intention to. - You know, if you went on estrogen, your sex drive wouldn't be so high and you wouldn't be guilt-tripping people into having sex with you. Just saying. - But then, Riley made a video revealing that she'd been on hormone therapy for a year and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery. This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video where she not only apologized to Riley and acknowledged her transition, but she actually went beyond the script of a generic oopsie doopsie YouTube video, and opened up about having experienced herself the cruelty she directed at Riley. - And I'm someone who's had my transition picked apart online. There have been Reddit threads and 4Chan threads with hundreds of comments on it, of people trying to prove that I'm not trans because I haven't done this or that or, you know, digging up my old pictures, so the thought that this entire time I've done that exact same thing to someone else and pushed that off on someone else f*cks with me and I'm f*cking sorry. - Vanessa actually managed, for one fleeting moment, to make a connection between her own past hurt and trauma and the pain she'd inflicted on another person, which is kind of a once in a lifetime event on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths who wouldn't muddy their shoes to save a drowning child, and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists who consume human misery a like glutton gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet. - You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that I should really try to stick to ideas, opinions, policy. - However, this lesson would not last. Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content well past the point it had become passe, making a video with Big Red in the thumbnail as recently as 2019. I admit I thought she was fading to irrelevance. But once again, I underestimated Vanessa. In July 2019, her channel rocketed to a new level of success when she released a video titled \"Exposing Jessica Yaniv: Trans Predator.\" In this video Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman, or rather she believes a man posing as a trans woman, called Jessica Yaniv. Who the f*ck is Jessica Yaniv? Well, as far as I can tell, everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true. Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal to close down several beauty salons that had refused to wax her hairy balls after she approached them about it in an awkward and creepy way. She has a long history of sending extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls. And she attempted to host a topless pool party for unchaperoned children. Basically Yaniv is someone who appropriates the language of transgender acceptance and equality to cloak predatory behavior toward minors. And my read on Yaniv by the way is not that she's a cunning manipulator, but that this is someone who's mentally not playing with a full deck. After the success of her initial video, Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv, re-branding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen, exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them. And at first I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa. At least now she's finally picking on someone who deserves it. But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have. One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story, and the lack of attention given to it by other trans public figures, as an indictment of trans activists, who Vanessa thinks should spend more time sounding the alarm about transgender predators. And I'm willing to admit there's probably a valid point in there somewhere. Like, some trans people really are so paranoid about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts, that they basically look the other way and refuse to acknowledge the small but real subset of trans people who are in fact dangerous perverts. But Blaire, you talk about the Yaniv situation like it's urgent breaking news, like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name, but for the stubborn silence of trans activists. But why? Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv? There's more than 100,000 sexual assaults reported to American law enforcement every year, the literal president of America is a bit of a sexual predator himself, why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep? I guess you could argue that since Yaniv is a trans-identified predator-a TIP!- we as real trans people have a responsibility to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her. Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that. And again I think there's maybe some truth to that, like initially the LGBT website PinkNews straightforwardly reported Yaniv's claims of discrimination, which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics. But I don't think that constantly broadcasting updates about the transgender pred- is really the best optics for us either. Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place? Is it simply because she cares deeply about the wellbeing of children and thought making a video exposing Yessica Yaniv is the best way protect them? I mean I'm sure she cares a little bit about the children. But it's still a YouTube video. And you have to ask, is the primary intention here really to stop a predator? Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle? Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published, Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel titled \"Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv: Trans Predator.\" This got two million views. Is this what you do with someone you've just accused of pedophilia? You host a live event debating the pedophile on your YouTube channel? What's to debate? - I don't need to be scared in my own house that I'm gonna get f*cking attacked. (electricity crackling) Which is illegal in Canada, just saying. - You think that was like cute? Was that a moment for you. - Then of course you sell T-shirts featuring the meme that resulted from your YouTube pedophile debate. I mean that makes sense. If you're gonna catch a predator, you gotta sell pedophile debate merch! And of course you gotta follow the pedophile's makeup tutorial. You know, for the children. Now, I hate to be overly-critical, but when I look at this I don't see a high-minded activist working to protect children and trans people's image. I see a tabloid entertainer who's discovered a way to monetize milking lols from a mentally defective pervert. And I have to say Blaire, as a connoisseur of trash myself, I'm very entertained by all of this. Following a sexual predator's makeup tutorial, that's genius. I wish I'd thought of it. But just be honest, this isn't activism, this isn't justice, it's a lolcow cult. It's like one Maury's transsexuals took over the show. And I love that for her. I love that for her. But Blaire, I can't help but notice, you're still hitting all the same beats your videos have always hit. Attention everyone. There is a bad transgender in our midst. The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me. It's very important that all we gather 'round to condemn this bad transgender who is not a real transgender. And Blaire I'll give you this, you are getting better at choosing your targets. The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture and Yessica Yaniv is good casting for that part. She's a transphobe's bogeyman come to life, and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her. But you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this seriously as anything more than a smarter version of the same ingroup-cringe humilitainment you've always made. And by the way, you may wanna check in on your understudy Rose of Dawn. Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber who produces a series called \"Trans-Stupid.\" - Hi, everyone. Welcome to another edition of \"Trans-Stupid\", the show where I take a look at the wonderful world LGBTQIA+++ news because stupidity is intersectional. - Transgender, more like, trans-retarded! More like, trans-gay! (laughing) Trans-gay, I love that. I'm literally, I just realized, I'm literally trans-gay. Rose's channel is allegedly about the excesses of trans ideology and activism, which in theory I do think is a perspective worth including in the conversation. But in practice, well, let's just say Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary about why Chris-Chan is not a real transgender. There is a bad transgender in our midst. The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me. I'm getting pretty tired of this. And here's her transition advice to trans women beginning their journey. - You probably have this image in your head that, you know, you're going to be this really cute-looking trans woman, like effectively you're going to be this seal. Like look at this seal. Isn't this seal adorable? You're so cute. But the truth is you're probably not looking like this seal right now, are you? You're probably more like this big bull seal, barging your way into women's bathrooms, saying, this is a woman's body. Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase. In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White. - Rose, no. Do not simp for Vanessa. It only encourages her. She's also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv. Which seems like kind of lot, gorg. Would I be wrong to say I'm getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe? In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv's numerous crimes and wrongdoings but she also cannot resist making it very clear how disgusted she is with Yaniv's appearance. - [Rose] The irony being that this kind of tweet came from someone you could smell, just by looking at a picture of them. - I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest at all in white knighting for Yaniv. I do not support her journey, as far as I'm concerned she can eat shit, and maybe she does. I wouldn't be surprised. No, my point is that part of the emotional catharsis that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive from making this kind of content, comes from contrasting themselves as good presentable real trans people, with the hideousness of the wretched fake-trans dump truck. A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves. On one half, Vanessa, looking fish, looking c*nt. Always with her lip gloss in the livestreams. And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast, the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig. And I'm allowed to say dump truck, because before I transitioned I was once one of Vanessa's dump trucks. I was one of, #HerDumpTrucks. Look I happen to possess a little thing, you probably haven't heard of, called inner beauty. That's right sweetie, my pancreas? Unclockable. (airhorn blowing) Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself with this cartoon, okay, straight-up refers to Yaniv as the Tubby Troon and the Titanic Tranner of Canada. - A particular titanic tranner of Canada. The titanic tranner of Canada. - Tranner and troon beings pejoratives for transgenders that I associate with 4chan, where I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of time. (chimes ringing) As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv's fatness, well I'm guessing that must be an important part of stopping a predator, right? - It seems almost taboo to condemn people for how rough they look when I think that that tough love in a way is needed because I look at what I looked like when I first transitioned and Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something, like I looked bad, like I was overweight, I had poor taste in clothes. Like I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything. It was mostly T-shirts and jeans. You're probably more like this big bull seal, barging your way into women's bathrooms, saying, this is a woman's body. Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase. In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White. I want to make it very clear that when I'm talking about transition, I don't mean-- - Rose, are you okay? No you're not okay. None of us are okay. No trans woman remotely in the public eye is in any way okay. And look I don't want to take this psychoanalysis too far. Because I don't know from watching YouTube videos what's going on in someone's head. But I can try to make intelligent inferences. And I think it's pretty revealing that this is how Rose introduces the topic of Jessica Yaniv: - One of the biggest characters in the whole f*cking world at the moment, which is Jessica Yaniv. - Rose, gorg, Yessica Yaniv is not one of \"The biggest characters in the world\", at any moment. This is not a world historical figure. At the end of the day, this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend off the streets of Vancouver BC. The only reason anyone has heard of her at all is that Vanessa decided to go full \"To Catch a Predator\" and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity. She's not one of the biggest characters in the world. But it sounds like what she is, Rose, is one of the important characters in your brain. This is distorted thinking. It's like A-Log comparing Chris-Chan to Hitler. You're so deep in the morbid cringe obsession that you've lost perspective. And I'm sure you have what seem to you like perfectly logical reasons for devoting so much attention to this, and I know that videos about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I'm sure that's a factor too. But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession when I see one. And I know that being a visible trans woman on the Internet is more difficult than most people can imagine. And I know that pretty much every trans person is bullied or shamed or humiliated at some point in our lives. And I know how good it can feel to take all the horrible things that transphobes and bullies and TERFs have said said about us, and repeat those things verbatim at some big, fat, fake, dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist. Oh, it feels good to get to be the TERF for once. It feels good to be the judge, rather than the judged. Because when you point the finger at someone else, you're also pointing away from yourself. And it's not lost on me that in conservative circles, queer people are often treated like suspected sex criminals by default. So there's safety in being the one who spearheads the think-of-the-children type moral crusade. And when you expose a trans predator, you get that feeling of safety plus the relief of having someone in particular to blame for the shame and the stigma we all feel. Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us. But that's just not true. It's a simple answer to a complicated problem. It's scapegoating. When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube, I see a community trying to cope with stigma, and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief. It's basically a blood sacrifice. It's not rational. It feels good for a moment, but it's an addiction. It won't ever erase the stigma and the shame. And Yaniv is simply the latest and the most deserving in a long line of bad transgenders who aren't real transgenders and are giving us a bad name and are the reason people hate us and must be condemned and destroyed. But when Yaniv is finally gone, when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is, you're just gonna find a new scapegoat to take her place. And the shame cycle continues. The humiliation and bullying we've experienced is internalized as shame. When we project that shame onto scapegoats and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt. And we voice that contempt by shaming other people, which starts a new cycle. So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags, new shamedumps, new lolcows, and you can wind up like one of the people who's been archiving Chris-Chan for 13 years, but that will never really heal us. God how do I get out of this video? I'm trying to have a serious conversation dressed as some kind of catgirl degenerate. Cringe. Shame! I'm ashamed. Don't look at me! You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers. Thank you! Yes I suppose it is groundbreaking. All right children, let's review our notes on cringe. The word cringe really describes two different emotions, either embarrassment or contempt. You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else. When you're embarrassed for someone else we call that vicarious embarrassment. And that can mean cringing with someone who is embarrassed themselves, which I've argued is excluded in the internet usage of the word cringe. Or it can mean embarrassment for someone who isn't embarrassed themselves, in which case we say we're cringing at them. Now if someone who's part of your ingroup is embarrassing themselves, and by proxy embarrassing the ingroup that includes you, you feel ingroup cringe, which can involve both vicarious embarrassment and a kind of self-cringe. And on the contempt side, contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you, particularly if they're traits you have contempt for in yourself, can develop into morbid cringe, which is that obsession with a lolcow, that addiction to contemptuous gazing at a dark mirror in which you see reflected everything you hate about yourself, or about your ingroup. Now I want to end this video by reflecting on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful. And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good. Embarrassment serves a social purpose, it helps us interact smoothly with each other by telling us what not to do. And empathizing with other people's embarrassing stories can be cathartic, it can make you feel closer to other people, more alike, less alone. I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe is very healthy. It shows you're self-aware, and you care at least a little bit what other people think. You know I've met people who never cringe at themselves. And, let's just say they're not my kind of people. They're narcissists who think super highly of themselves regardless of how they're actually coming across. But I think partly out of fear of ending up like one of those people, I've overcompensated, and I cringe too much, both at myself and at other people. It's a habit that is making me hate myself, and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others. And when I take a look around the Internet, like I've done in this video, I find that I'm not alone in this situation. And it's not cute. So, how do we cringe less? Well, the cliché solution is self-love, which our culture places a lot of value on, self-love and self-esteem. You know, I don't care what haters and losers say, I'm a bad bitch, I look like a supermodel, I'm a genius. We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way. But it doesn't work. Because it's not realistic. You don't look like a supermodel. And you're not a genius. And when you realize that, you fall from one extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls, \"The self-esteem Tower of Terror.\" So you go from self-love to self-hate. But self-hate is also a distortion. Recently I was listening to a David Foster Wallace interview, yeah, I know, cringe, and he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked. He said, \"There is a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.\" How dare you notice that. I'm in this photo and I don't like it. But it's true. Time spent cringing at yourself is time spent obsessing over yourself. And it's hard not to because humans are animals, so our perspective is egocentric by nature. But we can learn to appreciate that the world is bigger than us. I mean, I've heard rumors. In that book we started with, \"Cringeworthy\", Melissa Dahl advocates not self-love, or self-hate, but what she calls \"Self-indifference.\" She says, \"Self-indifference is the relief \"of realizing that you are simply not that big a deal.\" So yeah, I was cringey in the past, and I'm still pretty cringey now. But you know what? Everyone else is pretty cringey too. And the world is probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway so, I don't know if I would call this good news but, if it's any consolation, Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. (dreamy ethereal music)\n"

       "'(light classical music) - Hello again, the gays! Welcome to my garden party fantasy. Straight people are of course welcome to tag along too, provided you\\'re emotionally damaged. Hi! Hey how are you! Cringe! Let\\'s talk about it! The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately. It just pops into my head all the time. Like when I randomly remember that month back in 2013 when all my Facebook posts were just lyrics to Kesha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter? Why? What audience was that for? Who is this inconceivable person I used to be? Cringe! Megacringe! I think I say this word like 50 times a day, cringe cringe cringe. And I\\'m not the only one. Google Trends shows that in the US search interest in the word cringe has dramatically increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since. And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe is at an all-time high the month I\\'m making this video. So what is cringe? Well, let\\'s start with some examples. There was a recent thread on AskReddit titled \"What Things Really Make You Cringe?\" And here\\'s some of the most upvoted responses, \"The time I was talking too loud at a wedding \"when I wasn\\'t supposed to and everyone \"at the wedding turned around to see \"what asshole wouldn\\'t shut up.\" \"Recordings of my own voice.\" \"When I remember that I did the \\'I do have a boyfriend, \\'he just goes to another school\\' thing\" \"Early teen me. \"So many cringe stuff I did. \"I hope all of my old friends have forgotten about me\" \"This happened about two years ago. \"I ordered some Pizza Hut online \"and when it was delivered, \"the lady handed me the pizza boxes. \"I said thanks and she told me my shirt was inside out. \"I said oh, and then she hands me the receipt \"to sign and leave a tip, and I spend 30 seconds \"trying to get the pen to work. \"She looks at the pen and says \\'you have to click the pen.\\' \"I said oh, and then she reaches \"to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good. \"Then I said \\'you too\\' and then I closed the door \"and killed myself.\" All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl says in her book \"Cringeworthy: A Theory of Awkwardness.\" According to Dahl, \"The moments that make us cringe are when we\\'re yanked out \"of our own perspective, and we can suddenly \"see ourselves from somebody else\\'s point of view.\" She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who in the \\'60s did a study of the Biami tribe in New Guinea where he showed them mirror, video, and photographic images of themselves for the first time, and described the results: \"They were paralyzed: after their first startled \"response, covering their mouths and ducking \"their heads, they stood transfixed, \"staring at their images, \"only their stomach muscles betraying great tension.\" So basically, they cringed at themselves. Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing. Like, pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice when they hear a recording for the first time, I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating in your head. So when you hear the recording you realize oh God, that\\'s how other people hear me all the time. And you\\'re suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear to yourself, and the way you appear to other people. That\\'s when you cringe, that feeling Dahl describes as \"The intense visceral reaction produced \"by an awkward moment, an unpleasant kind \"of self-recognition where you suddenly \"see yourself through someone else\\'s eyes. \"It\\'s a forced moment of self-awareness, \"and it usually makes you cognizant \"of the disappointing fact \"that you aren\\'t measuring up to your own self-concept.\" When you\\'re talking too loud at a wedding and suddenly everyone turns around to see what asshole wouldn\\'t shut up, you suddenly realize how you look to them, because we\\'ve all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn\\'t shut up. But this time, you\\'re the asshole. Cringe! Oftentimes, it\\'s the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe. There\\'s no law of state or even of etiquette that tells you exactly how loud to speak at a wedding. It\\'s something you have to intuit based on context: how loud are other people speaking? Is the ceremony about to begin and we\\'re all supposed to be quiet now? According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael Here, the function of awkwardness is that-- - It sands social dynamics by smoothing out even what etiquette doesn\\'t rule on. - Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward. It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego. And memories of your cringey moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves. 10 years later you\\'ll be trying to fall asleep and for no reason at all your brain will decide to remind you of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding, and of the stupid thing you were saying when everyone turned around, and you\\'ll cringe all over again. That\\'s why remembering your teenage years is so painful, \\'cause you look back and you realize, damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years. Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don\\'t know, November? All the examples we\\'ve considered so far involve self-cringe, but usually when we talk about cringe on the Internet, we\\'re talking about cringing at other people. Popular subreddits like r/cringe, cringepics, and Cringetopia host videos and images of people behaving in cringey ways, for instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis, grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry, and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter with black people. - Who let the dogs out? Who, who? - Ugh watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire. It makes me wanna crawl out of my body and escape into another dimension. I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others. For me it\\'s uncomfortable to the point where I\\'ll reflexively pause a video like that because I just can\\'t stand it. In other words, it\\'s like watching my own YouTube videos, which sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room. So why is it that cringing at other people hurts the same way as cringing at yourself? Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment, or second-hand embarrassment. Basically, it\\'s a form of empathy. When you cringe at someone, you\\'re feeling the embarrassment that they\\'re feeling, just as if you see someone fall down the stairs you might wince empathetically with their pain. But there\\'s a problem with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe, or at least a complication. Which is that in the purest examples of cringe, the person doing the cringey thing isn\\'t feeling embarrassed. In fact, often they\\'re super confident, and it\\'s actually their lack of self-awareness about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe. Like when a woman posts a ridiculously over-Facetuned picture of herself as if anyone\\'s going to believe she looks like that, or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus. So in the Internet sense of the word, cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment. Someone tripping and falling onstage is embarrassing, and I do feel embarrassed for her. But she knows it\\'s embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed. - You guys are just standing up \\'cause I fell and that\\'s really embarrassing but thank you. - Nothing about this is cringe. Maybe to her, it\\'s self-cringe. Maybe she looks back on it and it\\'s still embarrassing. But I don\\'t cringe at her. Maybe there\\'s a difference between cringing at someone and cringing with them. When someone falls on stage I cringe with her, in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment; my feelings mirror what she\\'s feeling. But when I\\'m cringing at someone, I\\'m feeling something very different to what they\\'re feeling. I\\'m cringing at Captain Badass over here because he doesn\\'t have the decency to cringe at himself. Another example is bad American Idol auditions, which are quintessential cringe content. People try out for American Idol because they think they\\'re good enough singers to compete in a national competition. So they\\'re effectively revealing their own delusions when they show up and sing like this. ♪ Is this the real life ♪ ♪ Or is this just fantasy ♪ - It\\'s not just that he\\'s terrible that makes it cringe. Most of us are bad singers, right, when people sing Happy Birthday at a party, usually they\\'re singing in three different keys at no particular tempo. But that\\'s not cringe because the point of singing Happy Birthday is not to sound amazing. Bad American Idol auditions are cringe because of the contestants\\' misplaced confidence. - Who are you as good as in your opinion? - The lead singer from Queen. - It\\'s the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog. (singing out of tune) I admit that watching Red, I\\'m actually not in very much pain when I\\'m cringing at him. I laugh at his ludicrous performance, just like the judges do. And, because he\\'s so cocky, and because he doesn\\'t show signs of embarrassment himself, there\\'s a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure. There\\'s almost a sense of karma, a sense that because of his tragic hubris, he deserves the humiliation he\\'s bringing upon himself. And my sense that he deserves it suppresses my compassionate response, and it helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have about taking pleasure in someone\\'s humiliation. Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant, Meesha, who\\'s there with her mom, and they both seem like such sweethearts. - I do believe in her talent very much. - And yeah she\\'s delusional about her singing talent, but I\\'m routing for her, and when she embarrasses herself I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe. ♪ Don\\'t you wish your girlfriend was hot like me ♪ - Yikes. My differing reactions to Red and Meesha track a distinction that Dahl makes between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe. Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification with the person you\\'re cringing at. Even if they aren\\'t actually embarrassed themselves in the cringeworthy moment, you still feel the embarrassment they would feel or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware of how other people are perceiving them. Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand, involves an emotional distancing from the person you\\'re cringing at. Just like with compassionate cringe, you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves, but instead of feeling that embarrassment on their behalf, you feel annoyance and disgust at them, and maybe even a little schadenfreude. So these are actually two very different emotional responses, vicarious embarrassment versus contempt. But we call both feelings cringe, not because they\\'re similar feelings, but because they\\'re responses to the same type of situation: people lacking self-awareness embarrassing themselves without realizing it. Now, embarrassment and contempt, seem, at face value, like pretty unpleasant feelings. So why are we so fascinated by content that makes us feel that way? Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members? Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos so popular on YouTube? Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations? Well I think the answer to that question depends on whether we\\'re cringing compassionately or contemptuously. When I read that AskReddit thread, where all the people share their cringe stories, I cringe compassionately, that is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them. And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with them. I recognize myself in them, and I\\'m reassured to hear that other people are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am. I\\'m not the only one who cringes at my past, or at videos of myself; I\\'m not the only who\\'s says \"You too\", when the person says the pizza smells good. When we collectively laugh at these situations, we\\'re bonding over our shared human frailty. We\\'re recognizing that we all say the wrong thing sometimes. That we\\'ve all arrogantly argued for an opinion, only to later educate ourselves and realize how ignorant and wrong we were. That we\\'ve all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable, as beautiful, and talented, and badass; only to totally miss the mark and completely embarrass ourselves. And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses; it makes us feel less alone. Now, this is all of course assuming that we\\'re cringing compassionately. But I would argue that most cringe content on the Internet does not encourage compassion. And that\\'s kind of an uncomfortable fact, because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved. This is the 21st century, right? Pillories and freakshows and public floggings, these are barbaric practices from the Dark Ages, right? Surely no one the Internet would ever entertain themselves by humiliating people, right? (frantic circus music) We\\'ve got maniacs, we\\'ve got wackadoos, we\\'ve got schizos, fatties, and spergs! Come see sexual deviants on display! That\\'s right folks, we\\'ve got cackling perverts of every denomination! Come see the panty-sniffer, he\\'ll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings! Come see the skeleton girl, she hasn\\'t had a bite in 30 days! That\\'s right we\\'ve got real live lesbians! I\\'ll be your master of ceremonies: half man, half woman, all freak. Okay, we\\'ve heard enough heartwarming gibberish, welcome to the dark side of cringe. Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture. And by that I mean there\\'s whole channels making content that centers the experience of cringing, and there\\'s a huge audience that seeks out cringe content, which includes content the creator doesn\\'t intend to be cringe. I first started paying attention to this back in 2016, which was the heyday of the feminist cringe compilation or the SJW cringe compilation. Remember those? This is all ancient history by YouTube standards but in 2106, the word cringe was most associated with a teenage YouTuber called LeafyIsHere. His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video, which means he would play someone else\\'s content, then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is. ♪ No makeup with some sweatpants ♪ - [Man] Oh my God. It\\'s so f*cking bad. He looks like he\\'s genderfluid. He looks like a f*cking lesbian. - This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential, and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts and freethinking tuxedos. - [Man] What even is this thing? It must be one of the 76 genders. I didn\\'t realize retarded was a gender. - I\\'m sorry my dudes, you were on the cringe side of history. Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos. The logical antelope isn\\'t inviting you to foster a shared sense of humanity by recognizing your own weakness in the embarrassment of screeching feminists. No. This is an invitation to contempt. Here\\'s a YouTube video titled \"Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.\" You\\'d expect from the title that it would be a video of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways. But it isn\\'t. It\\'s literally just a compilation of fat people doing things. This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming. Is this cringe? What is cringe about it? Earlier we defined cringe as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt for someone who lacks self-awareness about the way others are perceiving them. But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there\\'s no context, so we don\\'t know anything about her mental state. And we certainly don\\'t know whether she\\'s self-aware about how she\\'s being perceived. If there was an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel, or if she tried to Photoshop herself to look like a size four, okay, maybe that would be cringe. But that\\'s not what\\'s going on in this clip. She\\'s just existing, in water. What cringe are we being invited to feel over this? Presumably, something along the lines of \"Ew, fat people. \"Gross.\" It\\'s literally just disgust, right? Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body. Here\\'s another cringe compilation, this one titled \"Genderfluid Non-Binary Cringe\" and we\\'re watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their genderfluid identity - Honestly it\\'s kind of terrifying because genderfluid people just aren\\'t as accepted. - Yeah apparently not. And judging from the fact that I\\'m currently watching this in a cringe compilation, it seems the person in the video was dead on about how other people will perceive them. But despite that self-awareness, we\\'re being invited to cringe. Because I guess being genderfluid, like being fat, is cringe in and of itself. Now, the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe. This isn\\'t real cringe, I want to say, cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others. But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread that there\\'s really no point in objecting to it. If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia, one of the sleazier cringe subreddits, you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow, a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper. These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts. They\\'re types of people who are widely ridiculed online. I\\'d like to share with you a list that I\\'ve put together of groups that are often considered to be cringe, Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels, neckbeards, fedora-tippers, gamers, TikTok teens, not-like-other-girls girls, fanfic writers, beat poets, SJWs, feminists, MAGAs, trans people, non-binary people, transtrenders, queer AFAB ukulele players, autistic people, fat people, the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled. Now I\\'m searching for some thread that all these groups have in common. And a handful of themes do jump out: Deviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual. A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism. The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure. Obsessive interests in unconventional hobbies. Low social status. It\\'s pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days. If you add up all the groups on this list, I bet it includes most of the people watching this video. It includes me three or four times. I\\'m, of course, a fedora-tipping, queer, AFAB ukulele-playing, TikTok teen. Can\\'t we just accept that we\\'re all a bit cringe and try to be like compassionate or whatever? (scoffing) F*ck no. The Internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullsh*t. Oh no, this is social reject \"Battle Royale.\" Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way, and I want to explore what the rewards might be. Let\\'s start by looking at the role of cringe in Internet politics, where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy. At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so, you couldn\\'t escape clips of this woman known as Big Red, a Toronto resident who showed up at a Men\\'s Rights event and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely. - It\\'s part of patriarchy. Part of patriarchy. I don\\'t know if you\\'re noticing a theme: Patriarchy. I\\'m reading, f*ckface. Mr. Entitled. Mr. Ego. Patriarchy f*ckface! - She\\'s one of these people who generates memeable phrases at an amazing rate. I actually think she\\'s hilarious and iconic, but, I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia. Anyway this video appeared in countless cringe compilations, reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays. Often Big Red was framed as like THE feminist, the mascot of feminism, a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists. Which is highly dishonest, considering she\\'s not even a high-profile activist or thinker. She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto. But because of this amusing 12-minute video, it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman, who, we we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form. I call this strategy mascotization, the construction of a strawman nemesis. What you do is you select a cringeworthy person and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team. It\\'s very simple, but very effective. And it\\'s best paired with memeification; that\\'s when you take a single moment in a person\\'s life, you freeze it, and you declare that that moment fully represents a person. Then, through mascotization, you declare that this memeified person represents an entire group or movement. Other right-wing memes from this era include this protestor. - You\\'re a f*cking white male. - Memeified as AIDS Skrillex. And this protestor. - Get your hate speech off this campus. Get your hate speech off this campus. - Who was memeified as Trigglypuff. The two of them symbolized the wretchedness of beta numale cuckoldry, and the hysteria of social justice crybullies, respectively. I guess the ultimate memeified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian, about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded. Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe, as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb-tier casual throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers. Other times it was almost a super-villainous caricature, this sort of dark devouring mother archetype, threatening to confiscate your video games and engulf you in her yonic abyss. Now it\\'s obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as supervillains is effective. Though it comes at the risk of backfiring by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful, a little too bad-ass. But the subtler strategy of symbolizing your political enemies with not an evil but a cringeworthy mascot works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense emotional way. Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule and if someone has been made a laughing stock, it\\'s much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing than it is to risk being laughed at yourself. To be cringe is to not be in on the joke. And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection, I think one reason we\\'re fascinated by cringe content is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at. When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online, laughing at someone and ridiculing them, we register an emotional memory of it as a warning: don\\'t act like that, or people will laugh at you. This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior. It\\'s why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals. You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory, at the whipping post; you see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables. And it sends a powerful message. Don\\'t do what that guy did. I don\\'t think the Internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it\\'s the 17th Century. There\\'s no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks, but instead, there\\'s teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos; there\\'s ex-boyfriends revenge-posting their girlfriend\\'s nudes; there\\'s vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone for alleged breaches of wokeness. Public humiliation is a powerful force, and it\\'s usually uh, it\\'s not a good force. But there are some rare exceptions. Back in the Gamergate era-Gamegate itself of course being a study in public humiliation, slut-shaming on a massive online scale- YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism. As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks, and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers who were constantly mobbed and harassed. What I see as one of the turning points in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days to the LeftTube world of today was a handful of videos uploaded by the then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis, in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual called Davis Aurini. - Come on Davis, no stop lecturing me about ethics we have to get out of here, and can you please stop trying to start a forest fire! - [Natalie] In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women, while posing in front a toy skull and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey. - Men of the West, women in our culture have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome. And so in discussing sluts versus whores, I would start with the premise that all women are whores. - Harry\\'s videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views and a fairly positive response even from a mostly male gamer audience, who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time. Why did these videos work with this audience, where so many others didn\\'t? Well, I think it\\'s because Harry didn\\'t moralistically call out Davis for being problematic or misogynistic. Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact that Davis is a cringeworthy buffoon. And Davis was a perfect target because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense; he had no self-awareness about the fact that pretty much everyone saw through his absurd posturing as a badass tough guy by day, profoundly dark philosopher by night. - We exist in a world with feminized legislation. - I\\'ve spoken to men and boys, who\\'ve told me that Harry\\'s videos inspired the beginnings of a feminist awakening in them, not just because they cringed at Davis Aurini, but also because they recognized a little bit of Davis in themselves, and they cringed at that too. Recognizing part of yourself in a cringeworthy person induces self-cringe, which can motivate you to change your behavior, your beliefs, or even your own self-concept. And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance of a recognizable stock character on the Internet, namely the fedora-tipper. Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader for traditional masculinity, but who\\'s basically just a pasty nerd who can\\'t relate to women. Davis was such an extreme version of this, and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments so frequently that I would classify him as what the Internet calls a lolcow. Lolcow is old 4chan lingo, it means a person whose unintentionally eccentric or foolish behavior can be milked for lols. Milking in this context can mean simply watching the lolcow\\'s behavior and laughing at them, or it can mean making reaction videos where you make fun of them, or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them to get a response that you find entertaining. I\\'d describe Harry\\'s videos about Davis, or my old videos about The Golden One as lolcow-milking content, with a political angle. It was essentially an argument from ridicule, an argument from cringe, with the aim of convincing people: don\\'t embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs. But also, and I\\'ll just speak for myself here, I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer. And I wanted people to laugh. There doesn\\'t need to be a political agenda behind milking lolcows, in fact usually there isn\\'t. The purest example of a lolcow I can think of is actually someone from way before the Internet, namely Florence Foster Jenkins. Jenkins, or Lady Florence as she liked to be called, was an American soprano who attracted a cult following in New York City during the 1920s, \\'30s and \\'40s due to her being such a terrible singer that people went to her concerts essentially for the lols. She was described as \"The world\\'s worst opera singer. \"No one, before or since, \"has succeeded in liberating themselves quite \"so completely from the shackles of musical notation.\" Behold this f*cking camp queen. Oh we have no choice but to stan. Here\\'s a short clip of one of the few recordings she made. (bird squawking) Cringe. So she was essentially the Tommy Wiseau, the William Hung of her age. Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence, until 1944, when she was 76 years old, and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert, to which newspaper critics showed up. The next morning, the New York Sun reported, \"Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking \"in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note \"was from its proper elevation the more \"the audience laughed and applauded.\" And five days later she had heart attack and died. I find something very touching about this story. I mean I\\'d probably be laughing as much as anyone if I were at Carnegie Hall that night, but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence. It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell; at least he tries to stop these people before things get out of hand. I think it\\'s normal to have mixed feelings about a lolcow. Like yes this is hilarious but on the other hand, doth not a lolcow bleed? On some level we know it\\'s wrong to entertain ourselves this way, but on the other hand, other people\\'s pain is incredibly entertaining. There\\'s a good book about this called \"The Joy of Pain: Schadenfreude and the Dark Side \"of Human Nature by Richard Smith.\" Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take in other people\\'s misery, and Smith argues that we experience it because psychologically we gain something when other people lose. We\\'re constantly evaluating our own worth by comparing ourselves to other people. So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost, a pleasant feeling of superiority from comparing ourselves to people beneath us, especially if we\\'re kind of insecure to begin with. Maybe I\\'m not perfect, but at least I\\'m not this lolcow. And we also get a boost when people who are socially above us, whom we envy, get brought down a peg. James Charles is canceled party, lolol. I think schadenfreude basically accounts for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com. Smith uses the word humilitainment for this type of media, like reality TV shows designed to produce spectacular moments of embarrassment. YouTube is basically a big reality TV show, or some kind of a carnival sideshow. I mean, take a look around you. We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who at the time I\\'m making this video remains apparently in total denial about her eating disorder, and continues to make videos modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers. We have WingsOfRedemption, a bad-tempered gamer who for a long time was essentially confined by poverty, obesity, and depression to streaming video games all day to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him. We have Onision, a habitual, alleged, abuser of women and teenage girls who earlier this year essentially performed his own mental breakdown on YouTube after Patreon banned him for doxxing an accuser. - I love kombucha. Whooo, whooo! - Whose idea was it to give hundreds of pathological narcissists access to video equipment? What kind of sick social experiment are we living in? And the viewers are no better than the performers. Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick. Oh, you people love nothing more than to watch one of us poor helpless egomaniacs completely lose our minds live on camera. - Is this what you want, huh? Is this what, you want a total meltdown! - You know as a creator you have to be aware that you\\'re a circus performer, and the crowd may in fact be more entertained if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers. Online media today is full of Lady Florences, anti-celebrities with anti-fans. Now, to be clear, I don\\'t think there\\'s anything inherently wrong with indulging now and then in a little bit of light contempt. Cringing at Davis Aurini or bad American Idol auditions seems pretty harmless, but it can be taken too far. And there\\'s no better case study of taking it too far than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler. If you don\\'t know what\\'s coming, you might wanna strap in gorg, cause this is coconuts, it\\'s bananas, it\\'s a full fruit salad. God how do I even begin to explain this? Well, Christine Weston Chandler, more commonly known on the Internet as Chris-Chan, is the victim of what is quite possibly the longest running and most obsessive Internet trolling saga of all time. She\\'s the lolcow of lolcows. - Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler. coming to you live from home once again. - Chandler is an autistic trans woman, and yes I will be calling her by she/her pronouns, which I pause to explain because I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen anyone actually take her transition seriously. Most people seem to regard it as simply another absurd symptom of her hilarious mental condition. In fact a bunch of trans people will probably get real salty with me for making trans people look bad by including Chris-Chan in our, oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club. Oh please. Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty; this is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society. God, how did tr@nnies get so snobbish? Look is Chris-Chan really trans? I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t care. If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman, I for one support her journey. But it doesn\\'t matter. The relevant thing about Chris-Chan is not Chris-Chan. It\\'s the fact that for the last 13 years, nearly every aspect of her life has been obsessively archived online by thousands of voyeurs known as Christorians. Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom several Internet centuries ago, back in 2007, when 4chan took notice of her comic-book series Sonichu, a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu. The comic is set in CWCville, CWC being Chris-Chan\\'s initials. The protagonist is a self-insert who references Chandler\\'s real-life quote \"Love Quest\" to find a quote, \"Boyfriend-free girl,\" which apparently involved posting bizarre \"attraction signs\" around her community college. For this story to make sense you have to keep in mind that Chandler identified and presented as male until 2015, so these trolls saw her as like the ultimate autistic incel manchild. Just to give you a feel for this person, here is Christine in 2018 holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait, note the Sonichu medallions, here is the bedroom she lived in, and here she is in recent years giving us a full bronycon eleganza. Pegasister snapped. Basically she\\'s the entire Cringetopia subreddit condensed into a single person. So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit, because of course they did, and they began tormenting her by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu, posting candid photos of her, et cetera. Chandler reacted to the trolls, which of course encouraged them more, and the harassment escalated and escalated. They hacked her accounts, or tricked her into giving out passwords, they posted all her emails online. They showed up in person and photographed her house. They called her parents posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers in order to extract as much information about her as possible. And of course they contacted Chandler herself, which was very rewarding for trolls, because she has no filter, and was very naive and trusting. So she was very willing to divulge, or was easily manipulated into divulging, mortifying information about herself, sexual, psychological, scatological, there\\'s not really any limits or boundaries to this. For all the information they gathered, the trolls created a Wiki, called the CWCki, devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris-Chan data. It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom, entire articles about all members of her immediate and extended family, pages of psychiatric records she was tricked into sending them, and that\\'s only the beginning. In their more grandiose moods, the Christorians have speculated that Chris-Chan is the most documented life in all human history, comparing their social experitainment to \"The Truman Show.\" It\\'s a level of obsession that surpasses the wildest excesses of stan culture. It is a gaze into the abyss that does not blink. Some trolls have also sent taunting letters and packages, or on one occasion sex workers to the Chandler household. Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates with Chris-Chan, of course secretly wearing wires to record their conversations. Others pretended to be her Internet girlfriends so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos. These things must be archived don\\'t you understand? Chris-Chan must be documented. The absolute low point came when some trolls encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl and have phone sex with Chris-Chan and record it. In other words, they groomed a child to deceive an autistic person into performing sex acts for their entertainment. Now to contemporary Christorians this sort of sadistic interference with Christine\\'s life is frowned upon, not so much because it\\'s immoral so much as because it\\'s considered a bit tacky, a bit attention seeking. No, to the sophisticated Christorian the real pleasure of all this is supposed to lie in quietly spectating, savoring the fine notes of cringe. Now I take it I don\\'t even need to comment on the morality of all this. The real question to me is why. Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession with Christine Chandler? And yes it is an obsession. Just to give a sense of a single individual\\'s personal investment in this, the YouTuber Geno Samuel, one of very few Christorians with the audacity to show his face, has been working for more than two years to produce an eventual-100-episode documentary series about the life of Chris-Chan. Geno has completed 36 episodes so far, and each episode is around 40 minutes long, meaning he\\'s already produced around 24 hours of video about the life of what is essentially a random stranger. I think this phenomenon deserves its own name. I\\'ll call it morbid cringe: defined as an obsessive and addictive contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group. Why does morbid cringe happen? Well, I\\'ve spent some time poring over Christorians\\' conversations with each other, and I\\'ve even interrogated a couple of them, and this is what I\\'ve found. The first thing they\\'ll tell you is they just think it\\'s funny and entertaining, that Christine\\'s strange life and mind simply appeals to their morbid curiosity. And I\\'m sure that\\'s true. But a lot of things are funny and entertaining and morbidly interesting. Why fixate on this particular person? Well, for a lot of them it\\'s a reassurance that there\\'s someone out there worse than them. Maybe they\\'re nerdy loners with no social skills, but at least this defenseless punching bag called Chris-Chan is here for them to assert their superiority over. It\\'s pretty much common knowledge that a lot of Christorians, including some of the most vocal haters, are autistic themselves. And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris-Chan is that she\\'s, \"Giving autistics a bad name.\" In recent years there\\'s also been a small contingent of transgender trolls, who are likewise prone to say, \"He\\'s not a real transgender like me \"and he\\'s making us all look bad.\" Oh, yeah, because people who troll Chris-Chan, you guys look amazing. It\\'s common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this about why trolling Chandler is justified, righteous even. Because at the end of the day, trolls are people too, and a lot of them actually do have a guilty conscience about this, which they suppress by insisting that Chris-Chan is a horrible person who deserves to be tormented. But trolls who protest-too-much about the evils of Chris-Chan, and therefore reveal the excess of their emotional investment in this, are known in the community as A-Logs. A-Log was a troll who attracted the ire of other trolls by ranting about about Chris-Chan\\'s crimes, comparing her to Hitler, and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession. Among the trolls this kind of behavior is considered an embarrassment to all of them, because they want to feel like they\\'re just coolly and casually toying with this person; you know, just for laughs, not a big deal, this is all perfectly healthy and normal and fine. It\\'s fine. But A-Log gave the lie to that illusion, because it was obvious that his Chris-Chan obsession wasn\\'t healthy or normal or fine. So the other trolls turned on A-Log and they made him into Chris-Chan 2.0, and they uncovered his autism and his furry porn collection and his cringey erotic fanfiction. So why would someone as similar to Chris-Chan as A-Log obsessively hate on her? Well there\\'s two explanations. One is trollshielding, that is A-Log may have performatively despised Chris-Chan and spearheaded the trolling efforts in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls. The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob by waving your pitchfork the hardest. Obviously this did not work. The other other explanation is that A-Log saw himself reflected in Chris-Chan, and sort of projected his own shame and self-contempt onto her. A-Log hated Chris-Chan because he saw part of himself in her. And the other trolls hated A-Log because they saw part of themselves in him. To quote Margaret Pless, who covered this story in New York Magazine a few years ago, \"I think it might be A-Logs all the way down.\" People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-Chan because to them she\\'s a symbol of something they hate about themselves; something they\\'re ashamed of. Maybe it\\'s being on the autism spectrum, or being a socially awkward recluse, maybe it\\'s being unemployed and living with their parents, or an adulthood fixation on children\\'s cartoons, or embarrassing sexual proclivities. Or all of the above. This is how scapegoating works, right, you repress your uncomfortable feelings of shame and insecurity and self-loathing, and you displace them onto someone else, usually someone you can feel superior to. Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat, transforming your painful shame and self-loathing into pleasant judgmental self-righteousness. It\\'s pretty safe to assume that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris-Chan. So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris-Chan is a way of processing the shame and anxiety of social rejection and exclusion. And I think for a lot of people, even normal people who aren\\'t part of a bizarre Internet stalker community, contemptuous cringing helps us cope with our own shame and insecurity. Anyway it\\'s time to stop this tedious empathizing with other people and find a way to make this all about me. (light orchestral music) (music box playing \"Danse Macabre\") (shushing) Meow meow. Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend? Would you like to meet my boyfriend\\'s boyfriend? That\\'s right, henny, I\\'m giving you fujoshi realness nyaa. He\\'s gonna stay right here as a grim reminder of the things that you have seen. Actually, I identify as a trap. It\\'s very that. I guess it\\'s not really cringe if I\\'m trying to be cringe. Cringe is failed seriousness. In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am of being a transgender lesbian. Cringe. Shame! At the end of that video I talk about how I sense that my shame is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel for a lot of other trans lesbians, particularly those of the heckin stripey-sock nya nya catgirl variety. But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians. I want to return to that thought, and kind of psychoanalyze myself as a kind of first-person case study of a morbid cringe obsession. So, catgirl trans girls are, I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to explain this. They\\'re trans women, usually attracted to women, who express their identity online through cloying, neotenous otaku memery. And my conscious reason for cringing at them is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls as a kind of visual baby-talk, an infantilized and unrealistic representation of femininity and womanhood that\\'s designed to titillate nerdy boys. So when trans women identify with it, I cringe. Like, no, you can\\'t become an anime girl, Lily. F*ck your dreams. Now look, I don\\'t want to get sidetracked with a discussion of whether my opinions about catgirls are fair or correct. So don\\'t listen to what I\\'m saying about catgirls. Listen to what I\\'m feeling about catgirls. Listen to the contempt beneath my words. Because even if everything I\\'m saying is true, \"Catgirls are being cringe online\" is a situation so inconsequential, that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much. So why do I have this cringe fixation? Well according to the A-Log Theory of Morbid Cringing, we form obsessive and addictive contempt for people who have traits in common with us; people who make us uncomfortable because we see something of ourselves in them. So do I have traits in common with the catgirls? Well, we\\'re both trans women. We\\'re both attracted to women. Um, I do like anime, but, I don\\'t like the anime they like, okay? I like good anime that has mature, three-dimensional female characters, look I\\'m a real transgender okay I\\'m not like you! It\\'s not lost on me that this is like the seventh time on this channel, I\\'ve dressed as a catgirl, \"to make fun of them.\" (scoffing) I have posted cringe, and you should all be laughing at me right now. Nyanyanyanyanyanya! So I do think there\\'s some truth to the idea that I\\'m A-Logging these catgirls. I also think there\\'s a group representation aspect to this, like I\\'m afraid that other people will cringe at a group that includes me, trans lesbians, because of how these catgirls are acting. So, let\\'s make yet another distinction between ingroup cringe and outgroup cringe. Ingroup cringe is when you cringe at someone who belongs to the same group identity as you, for example your family, your romantic partnership, your ethnicity, or your country. Particularly if they\\'re embarrassing themselves in front of outsiders to the group. Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends. Or, think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump being our president. Or, think about the phrases, \"She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber\", \"They\\'re making trans people look bad\", \"He\\'s giving autistics a bad name.\" When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group, we don\\'t just feel vicarious embarrassment, we feel embarrassment, because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too. So ingroup cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe, because you\\'re cringing at your membership in an embarrassing group. Nothing has ever triggered this kind of ingroup embarrassment more for me than a cringe video that went viral last year in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum over being misgendered in a GameStop. - [Woman] You\\'re gonna give me my f*cking money back. - [Woman] Excuse me, sir, there\\'s a young man here. You need to watch your mouth. - Excuse me, it\\'s ma\\'am. It is ma\\'am. - This video is excruciating for me to watch. - Motherf*cker, take it outside. If you wanna call me sir again, I will show you a f*cking sir. - [Man] I apologize. - [Woman] Motherf*cker. - [Man] I apologize, ma\\'am. (grunting) - The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly intimidate people into seeing you as a woman. (grunting) Now Twitter\\'s gonna come for me over this and say \"Natalie hates trans women who don\\'t pass.\" But passing is really not what this is about. It\\'s aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior from a trans woman, accompanied by apparently total delusion about how she\\'s presenting. - Well I\\'m gonna ask you for the fifth time to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I am not. - It\\'s really not that clear, gorg. And that\\'s what makes this video classic cringe, right, the incongruity between her thinking that she\\'s serving woman while bellowing like a drill sergeant. By the way, what I\\'m doing right now, this is cringe reaction content. I don\\'t really do that on this channel, but I\\'m dipping my toe in just to see how it feels. And it feels good. Like, intoxicatingly good. I can see how you could get addicted to this. I\\'m imagining myself right now surrounded by cis people and I\\'m leading the righteous mob as we all point and laugh at some delusional manly dump truck. I am a real transgender, a true transgender, a good transgender, father finally approves of me! Uh, this would be the unconscious archetypal father. Jot that down in my progress notes please, Doctor. Okay so why does this feel so good? Well, let me talk you through my feelings. When I watch that GameStop video, for first few seconds, I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her. I can even relate, because in the first couple months of my transition, there was an occasion where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction where the guy at the desk was calling me sir the entire time. And there\\'s something very humiliating about trying to present female, like wearing a dress and makeup, and yet being called sir. It\\'s a quintessential mismatch between self-concept and the way other people are seeing you. And the memory of it is painful to me, but what I cling to is that while I may have looked like man, at least I didn\\'t act like a man. I didn\\'t threaten to take anyone outside and \"Show them a sir.\" In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy. So as the GameStop video progresses, my sympathy runs out fast. And instead of compassionate cringe, I feel group embarrassment for trans women including myself, and I feel contempt towards this individual for making us all look bad. I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear: what if I\\'m as delusional as this trans woman? I don\\'t look and sound like that, do I? I feel like I have to do a sanity check. I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror, listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure. That fear motivates me to distance myself from the person in the video. I don\\'t feel compassion for her because that would mean putting myself in her size 16 shoes. And I don\\'t want to do that because I\\'m horrified and repulsed by the thought that I\\'m like her in some way. So I want to push away, and contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself. And if I express that contempt by publicly shaming and condemning her, then I\\'m also socially distancing myself. Accidental Covid jokes. Oops, guess it\\'s uh, contagious. (crowd booing) I think many people who are stigmatized, or who have been humiliated, long for the experience of being a normal, surrounded by fellow normals, judging and humiliating a freak. And if you take a look around trans YouTube, a lot of the biggest creators on the platform have channels that are basically devoted to exactly this type of cringe-reaction humilitainment. The YouTuber Kalvin Garrah is a trans guy who is best known for what are essentially cringe reaction videos, mostly aimed at people he deems transtrenders. That is, people who claim to be trans but who aren\\'t real transgenders like Kalvin. He\\'s especially bothered by girly AFAB trans and non-binary teenagers, or by anyone who muddies the line between trans-masculine and lesbian identities. Sometimes he\\'ll do a long form reaction to a specific person who grinds his gears. - So this person is an asexual, non-binary, transgender lesbian, who uses he/they/its/thons pronouns. According to my calculation, you are a transtrender. - [Natalie] And other times he\\'ll basically just laugh at cringey trans TikTok teens. (laughing) - No, no, I\\'m turning off the video. I can\\'t watch this. - He has a couple justifications for making these videos. One is that he\\'s actually helping the people he\\'s cringing at, because if a trender transitions, then they\\'ll give themselves dysphoria and they\\'ll have to detransition. But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people really help them figure out whether they\\'re trans or not? His other justification is that transtrenders are giving real trans people a bad name; they\\'re the reason people are transphobic, this is why they hates us. It\\'s because of the trenders. Wow, I love the idea of a truscum furry. Isn\\'t that just, isn\\'t that just wonderful? A truscum furry! But it\\'s not though. Transphobia existed long before there were people you could plausibly describe as transtrenders. So transtrenders are not the reason society hates trans people, Kalvin. They\\'re the reason you hate trans people, right? Or at least the trans community. And I feel like what you\\'re doing is you\\'re projecting that feeling onto society at large and saying oh this is the reason people are transphobic. And to be fair I get that it\\'s not just a projection. Back in 2016, the SJW cringe era, it was cis people mocking trans people with all these tropes: attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders, special snowflakes. But now they\\'re used by trans people trying to distance themselves, trying to ghettoize the most laughed at people in the community under the label of transtrenders. And Kalvin there may be some truth to what you\\'re saying about there being confused teenagers who think they\\'re trans when they\\'re not; I mean I wouldn\\'t know cause I\\'m a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life. I don\\'t hang out with teenagers, But if even it is true, Kalvin, your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me. Like, you return to this topic to cringe again and again and again and again and again, it\\'s like you\\'re picking at a wound. It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession, and I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you. This could be me projecting of course but, I wonder if the way you feel about girly sparklegender AFABs is similar to the way I feel about otaku transbian catgirls. And it might be worth considering that I don\\'t cringe at the sparklegenders the way you do. I mean I\\'m with on you on wondering what a he/they/xir genderflux lesbian demiboy is, but unlike you, Kalvin, I just don\\'t have a morbid cringe obsession with feminine AFAB trans people. They can identify as however many genders they want for all I care. I may not always understand it, but I support their journey. I guess it doesn\\'t bother me because I\\'m not worried that anyone will judge me because of how they behave. I don\\'t feel ingroup cringe. Now, it\\'s a different story if I\\'m reading a general lesbian subreddit and I see a comment like: \"Pre-transition trans lesbian here. \"I wish I had titties. \"Girldick nya nya!\" Get the f*ck out of here, Lily! You\\'re giving real trans lesbians a bad name! This is why they hate us! See now I have strong feelings. Now I\\'m ingroup cringing. And intellectually, I do think think my feelings are correct to some extent. Like I don\\'t think a general lesbian community is the appropriate forum for a trans woman who\\'s effectively still living as a man to take the mic and whine about wanting titties or rhapsodize about girldick. But I\\'m also aware that I feel this strongly about this because of my own dysphoria, and my own shame, and, honestly, my self-loathing. Like, I can\\'t even talk to cis women on dating apps, because I feel like a fake woman imposing myself on real women. That\\'s where my head is at. So, where does this pre-transition trans lesbian get the audacity! You know it makes me feel ingroup cringe about an identity, trans lesbianism, which for me is already a pain point of insecurity, embarrassment, and shame. So Kalvin maybe, and again I could just be projecting, but maybe that\\'s kind of like how you feel about these trenders. When you make videos condemning them as not really trans, aren\\'t you essentially exiling them from the ingroup, so that you no longer feel the pain of ingroup cringe? Or perhaps, Kalvin Garrah, what you\\'re really trying to destroy is the trender within. (bell ringing) And again I could be full of sh!t here. At the end of the day this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven\\'t met. So feel free to tell me if I\\'m full of sh!t Kalvin, but still, I guess I invite you to consider whether producing transtrender humilitainment is actually helping anything, or whether it\\'s just an addictive way to scratch some kind of emotional itch. All right, I\\'ve said my piece about Kalvin. Who\\'s next? Oh how about, Vanessa. We meet again, gorg. And once again, I\\'m wearing some kind of embarrassing anime hairpiece. Vanessa is a trans woman who is, the second most popular political trans YouTuber. At least that\\'s what I wrote in the script when I had more subscribers than her and was fully prepared to be a c*nt about it, but since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again. Good for her. Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel back when SJW cringe was fashionable. She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs but the most consistent theme was transtrenders and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name, they\\'re making us look bad, this why people hate us. So what we can now recognize as a standard ingroup cringe fixation. But Vanessa focused in particular on a strident SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis. And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her where she made a point of misgendering Riley, and dismissing her as a fake transgender who hadn\\'t transitioned and clearly had no intention to. - You know, if you went on estrogen, your sex drive wouldn\\'t be so high and you wouldn\\'t be guilt-tripping people into having sex with you. Just saying. - But then, Riley made a video revealing that she\\'d been on hormone therapy for a year and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery. This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video where she not only apologized to Riley and acknowledged her transition, but she actually went beyond the script of a generic oopsie doopsie YouTube video, and opened up about having experienced herself the cruelty she directed at Riley. - And I\\'m someone who\\'s had my transition picked apart online. There have been Reddit threads and 4Chan threads with hundreds of comments on it, of people trying to prove that I\\'m not trans because I haven\\'t done this or that or, you know, digging up my old pictures, so the thought that this entire time I\\'ve done that exact same thing to someone else and pushed that off on someone else f*cks with me and I\\'m f*cking sorry. - Vanessa actually managed, for one fleeting moment, to make a connection between her own past hurt and trauma and the pain she\\'d inflicted on another person, which is kind of a once in a lifetime event on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths who wouldn\\'t muddy their shoes to save a drowning child, and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists who consume human misery a like glutton gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet. - You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that I should really try to stick to ideas, opinions, policy. - However, this lesson would not last. Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content well past the point it had become passe, making a video with Big Red in the thumbnail as recently as 2019. I admit I thought she was fading to irrelevance. But once again, I underestimated Vanessa. In July 2019, her channel rocketed to a new level of success when she released a video titled \"Exposing Jessica Yaniv: Trans Predator.\" In this video Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman, or rather she believes a man posing as a trans woman, called Jessica Yaniv. Who the f*ck is Jessica Yaniv? Well, as far as I can tell, everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true. Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal to close down several beauty salons that had refused to wax her hairy balls after she approached them about it in an awkward and creepy way. She has a long history of sending extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls. And she attempted to host a topless pool party for unchaperoned children. Basically Yaniv is someone who appropriates the language of transgender acceptance and equality to cloak predatory behavior toward minors. And my read on Yaniv by the way is not that she\\'s a cunning manipulator, but that this is someone who\\'s mentally not playing with a full deck. After the success of her initial video, Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv, re-branding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen, exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them. And at first I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa. At least now she\\'s finally picking on someone who deserves it. But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have. One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story, and the lack of attention given to it by other trans public figures, as an indictment of trans activists, who Vanessa thinks should spend more time sounding the alarm about transgender predators. And I\\'m willing to admit there\\'s probably a valid point in there somewhere. Like, some trans people really are so paranoid about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts, that they basically look the other way and refuse to acknowledge the small but real subset of trans people who are in fact dangerous perverts. But Blaire, you talk about the Yaniv situation like it\\'s urgent breaking news, like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name, but for the stubborn silence of trans activists. But why? Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv? There\\'s more than 100,000 sexual assaults reported to American law enforcement every year, the literal president of America is a bit of a sexual predator himself, why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep? I guess you could argue that since Yaniv is a trans-identified predator-a TIP!- we as real trans people have a responsibility to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her. Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that. And again I think there\\'s maybe some truth to that, like initially the LGBT website PinkNews straightforwardly reported Yaniv\\'s claims of discrimination, which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics. But I don\\'t think that constantly broadcasting updates about the transgender pred- is really the best optics for us either. Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place? Is it simply because she cares deeply about the wellbeing of children and thought making a video exposing Yessica Yaniv is the best way protect them? I mean I\\'m sure she cares a little bit about the children. But it\\'s still a YouTube video. And you have to ask, is the primary intention here really to stop a predator? Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle? Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published, Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel titled \"Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv: Trans Predator.\" This got two million views. Is this what you do with someone you\\'ve just accused of pedophilia? You host a live event debating the pedophile on your YouTube channel? What\\'s to debate? - I don\\'t need to be scared in my own house that I\\'m gonna get f*cking attacked. (electricity crackling) Which is illegal in Canada, just saying. - You think that was like cute? Was that a moment for you. - Then of course you sell T-shirts featuring the meme that resulted from your YouTube pedophile debate. I mean that makes sense. If you\\'re gonna catch a predator, you gotta sell pedophile debate merch! And of course you gotta follow the pedophile\\'s makeup tutorial. You know, for the children. Now, I hate to be overly-critical, but when I look at this I don\\'t see a high-minded activist working to protect children and trans people\\'s image. I see a tabloid entertainer who\\'s discovered a way to monetize milking lols from a mentally defective pervert. And I have to say Blaire, as a connoisseur of trash myself, I\\'m very entertained by all of this. Following a sexual predator\\'s makeup tutorial, that\\'s genius. I wish I\\'d thought of it. But just be honest, this isn\\'t activism, this isn\\'t justice, it\\'s a lolcow cult. It\\'s like one Maury\\'s transsexuals took over the show. And I love that for her. I love that for her. But Blaire, I can\\'t help but notice, you\\'re still hitting all the same beats your videos have always hit. Attention everyone. There is a bad transgender in our midst. The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me. It\\'s very important that all we gather \\'round to condemn this bad transgender who is not a real transgender. And Blaire I\\'ll give you this, you are getting better at choosing your targets. The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture and Yessica Yaniv is good casting for that part. She\\'s a transphobe\\'s bogeyman come to life, and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her. But you\\'ll have to excuse me if I don\\'t take this seriously as anything more than a smarter version of the same ingroup-cringe humilitainment you\\'ve always made. And by the way, you may wanna check in on your understudy Rose of Dawn. Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber who produces a series called \"Trans-Stupid.\" - Hi, everyone. Welcome to another edition of \"Trans-Stupid\", the show where I take a look at the wonderful world LGBTQIA+++ news because stupidity is intersectional. - Transgender, more like, trans-retarded! More like, trans-gay! (laughing) Trans-gay, I love that. I\\'m literally, I just realized, I\\'m literally trans-gay. Rose\\'s channel is allegedly about the excesses of trans ideology and activism, which in theory I do think is a perspective worth including in the conversation. But in practice, well, let\\'s just say Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary about why Chris-Chan is not a real transgender. There is a bad transgender in our midst. The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me. I\\'m getting pretty tired of this. And here\\'s her transition advice to trans women beginning their journey. - You probably have this image in your head that, you know, you\\'re going to be this really cute-looking trans woman, like effectively you\\'re going to be this seal. Like look at this seal. Isn\\'t this seal adorable? You\\'re so cute. But the truth is you\\'re probably not looking like this seal right now, are you? You\\'re probably more like this big bull seal, barging your way into women\\'s bathrooms, saying, this is a woman\\'s body. Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase. In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White. - Rose, no. Do not simp for Vanessa. It only encourages her. She\\'s also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv. Which seems like kind of lot, gorg. Would I be wrong to say I\\'m getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe? In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv\\'s numerous crimes and wrongdoings but she also cannot resist making it very clear how disgusted she is with Yaniv\\'s appearance. - [Rose] The irony being that this kind of tweet came from someone you could smell, just by looking at a picture of them. - I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest at all in white knighting for Yaniv. I do not support her journey, as far as I\\'m concerned she can eat shit, and maybe she does. I wouldn\\'t be surprised. No, my point is that part of the emotional catharsis that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive from making this kind of content, comes from contrasting themselves as good presentable real trans people, with the hideousness of the wretched fake-trans dump truck. A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves. On one half, Vanessa, looking fish, looking c*nt. Always with her lip gloss in the livestreams. And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast, the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig. And I\\'m allowed to say dump truck, because before I transitioned I was once one of Vanessa\\'s dump trucks. I was one of, #HerDumpTrucks. Look I happen to possess a little thing, you probably haven\\'t heard of, called inner beauty. That\\'s right sweetie, my pancreas? Unclockable. (airhorn blowing) Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself with this cartoon, okay, straight-up refers to Yaniv as the Tubby Troon and the Titanic Tranner of Canada. - A particular titanic tranner of Canada. The titanic tranner of Canada. - Tranner and troon beings pejoratives for transgenders that I associate with 4chan, where I\\'m guessing Rose has spent a lot of time. (chimes ringing) As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv\\'s fatness, well I\\'m guessing that must be an important part of stopping a predator, right? - It seems almost taboo to condemn people for how rough they look when I think that that tough love in a way is needed because I look at what I looked like when I first transitioned and Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something, like I looked bad, like I was overweight, I had poor taste in clothes. Like I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything. It was mostly T-shirts and jeans. You\\'re probably more like this big bull seal, barging your way into women\\'s bathrooms, saying, this is a woman\\'s body. Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase. In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White. I want to make it very clear that when I\\'m talking about transition, I don\\'t mean-- - Rose, are you okay? No you\\'re not okay. None of us are okay. No trans woman remotely in the public eye is in any way okay. And look I don\\'t want to take this psychoanalysis too far. Because I don\\'t know from watching YouTube videos what\\'s going on in someone\\'s head. But I can try to make intelligent inferences. And I think it\\'s pretty revealing that this is how Rose introduces the topic of Jessica Yaniv: - One of the biggest characters in the whole f*cking world at the moment, which is Jessica Yaniv. - Rose, gorg, Yessica Yaniv is not one of \"The biggest characters in the world\", at any moment. This is not a world historical figure. At the end of the day, this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend off the streets of Vancouver BC. The only reason anyone has heard of her at all is that Vanessa decided to go full \"To Catch a Predator\" and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity. She\\'s not one of the biggest characters in the world. But it sounds like what she is, Rose, is one of the important characters in your brain. This is distorted thinking. It\\'s like A-Log comparing Chris-Chan to Hitler. You\\'re so deep in the morbid cringe obsession that you\\'ve lost perspective. And I\\'m sure you have what seem to you like perfectly logical reasons for devoting so much attention to this, and I know that videos about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I\\'m sure that\\'s a factor too. But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession when I see one. And I know that being a visible trans woman on the Internet is more difficult than most people can imagine. And I know that pretty much every trans person is bullied or shamed or humiliated at some point in our lives. And I know how good it can feel to take all the horrible things that transphobes and bullies and TERFs have said said about us, and repeat those things verbatim at some big, fat, fake, dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist. Oh, it feels good to get to be the TERF for once. It feels good to be the judge, rather than the judged. Because when you point the finger at someone else, you\\'re also pointing away from yourself. And it\\'s not lost on me that in conservative circles, queer people are often treated like suspected sex criminals by default. So there\\'s safety in being the one who spearheads the think-of-the-children type moral crusade. And when you expose a trans predator, you get that feeling of safety plus the relief of having someone in particular to blame for the shame and the stigma we all feel. Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us. But that\\'s just not true. It\\'s a simple answer to a complicated problem. It\\'s scapegoating. When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube, I see a community trying to cope with stigma, and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief. It\\'s basically a blood sacrifice. It\\'s not rational. It feels good for a moment, but it\\'s an addiction. It won\\'t ever erase the stigma and the shame. And Yaniv is simply the latest and the most deserving in a long line of bad transgenders who aren\\'t real transgenders and are giving us a bad name and are the reason people hate us and must be condemned and destroyed. But when Yaniv is finally gone, when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is, you\\'re just gonna find a new scapegoat to take her place. And the shame cycle continues. The humiliation and bullying we\\'ve experienced is internalized as shame. When we project that shame onto scapegoats and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt. And we voice that contempt by shaming other people, which starts a new cycle. So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags, new shamedumps, new lolcows, and you can wind up like one of the people who\\'s been archiving Chris-Chan for 13 years, but that will never really heal us. God how do I get out of this video? I\\'m trying to have a serious conversation dressed as some kind of catgirl degenerate. Cringe. Shame! I\\'m ashamed. Don\\'t look at me! You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers. Thank you! Yes I suppose it is groundbreaking. All right children, let\\'s review our notes on cringe. The word cringe really describes two different emotions, either embarrassment or contempt. You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else. When you\\'re embarrassed for someone else we call that vicarious embarrassment. And that can mean cringing with someone who is embarrassed themselves, which I\\'ve argued is excluded in the internet usage of the word cringe. Or it can mean embarrassment for someone who isn\\'t embarrassed themselves, in which case we say we\\'re cringing at them. Now if someone who\\'s part of your ingroup is embarrassing themselves, and by proxy embarrassing the ingroup that includes you, you feel ingroup cringe, which can involve both vicarious embarrassment and a kind of self-cringe. And on the contempt side, contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you, particularly if they\\'re traits you have contempt for in yourself, can develop into morbid cringe, which is that obsession with a lolcow, that addiction to contemptuous gazing at a dark mirror in which you see reflected everything you hate about yourself, or about your ingroup. Now I want to end this video by reflecting on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful. And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good. Embarrassment serves a social purpose, it helps us interact smoothly with each other by telling us what not to do. And empathizing with other people\\'s embarrassing stories can be cathartic, it can make you feel closer to other people, more alike, less alone. I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe is very healthy. It shows you\\'re self-aware, and you care at least a little bit what other people think. You know I\\'ve met people who never cringe at themselves. And, let\\'s just say they\\'re not my kind of people. They\\'re narcissists who think super highly of themselves regardless of how they\\'re actually coming across. But I think partly out of fear of ending up like one of those people, I\\'ve overcompensated, and I cringe too much, both at myself and at other people. It\\'s a habit that is making me hate myself, and it\\'s making me unfairly contemptuous towards others. And when I take a look around the Internet, like I\\'ve done in this video, I find that I\\'m not alone in this situation. And it\\'s not cute. So, how do we cringe less? Well, the cliché solution is self-love, which our culture places a lot of value on, self-love and self-esteem. You know, I don\\'t care what haters and losers say, I\\'m a bad bitch, I look like a supermodel, I\\'m a genius. We\\'re encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way. But it doesn\\'t work. Because it\\'s not realistic. You don\\'t look like a supermodel. And you\\'re not a genius. And when you realize that, you fall from one extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls, \"The self-esteem Tower of Terror.\" So you go from self-love to self-hate. But self-hate is also a distortion. Recently I was listening to a David Foster Wallace interview, yeah, I know, cringe, and he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked. He said, \"There is a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.\" How dare you notice that. I\\'m in this photo and I don\\'t like it. But it\\'s true. Time spent cringing at yourself is time spent obsessing over yourself. And it\\'s hard not to because humans are animals, so our perspective is egocentric by nature. But we can learn to appreciate that the world is bigger than us. I mean, I\\'ve heard rumors. In that book we started with, \"Cringeworthy\", Melissa Dahl advocates not self-love, or self-hate, but what she calls \"Self-indifference.\" She says, \"Self-indifference is the relief \"of realizing that you are simply not that big a deal.\" So yeah, I was cringey in the past, and I\\'m still pretty cringey now. But you know what? Everyone else is pretty cringey too. And the world is probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway so, I don\\'t know if I would call this good news but, if it\\'s any consolation, Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. (dreamy ethereal music)'"

Biden is no better than Trump.The Dems are just Republicanswith a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility.- Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs,but it is simply not true that there's no differencebetween them and the Republicans.I remember leftists saying in 2016that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary.But there's a lot of things Trump did that Hillarywould not have done.Things like, filling the supreme courtwith anti-abortion fanatics,withdrawing from the Paris Agreement,appointing climate change deniers to head climate research,attempting to remove medical non-discrimination protectionsfor trans people, constantly maligningthe integrity of elections with no evidence,declaring the press the enemy of the people,calling white nationalist militias very fine peopleand telling them to stand by,aspiring to be an autocratic dictatorand disdaining democracy itself,trivializing a deadly pandemicin the name of delusional macho posturing.So sure, the Democrats suck and they're libs,but it makes a real difference if they're in controlinstead of Republicans, especially if you're a woman,or LGBTQ, or a human who lives on the planet Earth.- [Tabby] So Biden will give us rainbow capitalismand streets named after Black Lives Matter,but he'll do nothing to bring about systemic change.- Well Tabby-chan,I'm sorry to say I agree with you about that.I fully expect to vote for Bidenand then protest the administration that I voted for.- [Tabby] So you sit here vote-shaming meand in the next breath admitting it won't do anything.You're a counter-revolutionary libwith no plan except just vote.- Tabby-chan, Tabby-chan.Look, I promise I'm not as dumbas I apparently look, comrade.Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote,they think you're saying quit your job,abandon your family, retreat from societyand fall into a deep slumberfrom which you emerge once every four yearsto vote for a shitty lib,before fleeing into the forestand re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slabin an eldritch temple awaiting the return of Beelzebub.(cymbals cling)Voting doesn't take that long.At most it takes one day.You can vote and do other things also.I guess you're probably still mad about that white womanwith the \"we'd be at brunch\" sign.And I feel you, though to be honest,I would eat a Louis XVI style armchairwith a pair of chopsticksif it meant I got to go to brunch right now.- [Tabby] Could you be any bougier?- Don't call me bougie. I'm beyond bougie.When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie,I scoff at them openly.I've have enough of this radlib merchant class tryingto abolish my fiefdom.- [Tabby] You're a famous YouTuber whose class interestsdo not align with mine.Why should I listen to what you say?- Oh, you shouldn't.I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly.But also I'm degenerate class traitorand, in my opinion, influencers should bethe first against the wall.Honestly, I just wish you'd just guillotine me quicklyand get it over with.You at least have to admire that about us libs.We have a remarkable willingnessto have polite conversations with peoplewho are trying to kill us.Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my planbut what is your plan Tabitha?- [Tabitha] Uh, protest, unionize, mutual aid, strikes...- So I totally agree, those are all good things to do.I've gone to protests myself this year myself,I've supported a mutual aid group.You're right, voting won't fix all our problemsand it's great to get involved in local things like that.But it still matters who's on the supreme courtand who's leading the national response to the coronavirus.So in addition to whatever else you're doing, vote.- [Tabby] Why participate in the charadeof a farcical election?America is not democratic.It's a rigged two-party corporatocracy.\"- (sighs) Well, I mean, (sighs) yeah.There's a lot wrong with our elections,big money financing campaigns, the electoral college,gerrymandering, voter suppression, DC being disenfranchised.All of this should obviously should be changed.But I don't think that in this moment,leftists boycotting the electionis an effective form of protest.- [Tabby] Okay, but voting is for liberal normieswho use Facebook and Reddit, ew.- Okay, it's true that voting is not cool.It's boring, it's incrementalist,it doesn't make you feel like you're owning the libsor being edgier than your parents.But you could always vote in secretand maintain your radical image around your friends.Isn't being involved in politics inherently not cool?Because politics is for people who care,people who believe in things,people who place their hope in fallible human beings.All of which is very not cool.I feel like so much Internet politics,whether it's radical or centrist, is just posturing.It's showcasing that you're funnier and smarterthan the normies, that you see through all the bullshit,the corrupt system, the electoral farce.But all you're doing about it is sitting here shitpostingand demeaning the peoplewho are actually trying to accomplishwhat little can be accomplished.And in effect, edgy leftists who complainabout both sides and do nothingare no different from edgy centristswho complain about both sides and do nothing.- [Tabby] Okay, but you, yourself said Trumpis an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.Why bother voting against someonewho won't leave office even if he loses?This ends in violence either way so we may as well smash.- Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly.But if there's a decisive Biden victoryand it's not some kind of vote-recount nightmare scenario,then I think the military will force Trump to leave.Don't get me wrong Tabby-chan, times are tough.The president is a fascist.I think this country is closerto some kind of violent uprisingthan it's ever been in my life.But if it comes to smashing, you're gonna want allies.And for a lot of people,Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory,and therefore, rejecting democracy itself,that would legitimize smashing.So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.- [Tabby] But capitalism is the root of the problemswith our world.The whole system is broken and voting won't change that.We don't need a Democrat, we need to end capitalism.- Tabitha, capitalism is an epochal world economic order.When you say end capitalism,you're talking about a tectonic shift in global politicsthat is so much bigger than all of usthat I don't really understand what course of actionyou're recommending.Like before capitalism there was feudalism.And feudalism ended over hundreds of yearsof complex shifts in population and production,not because people just decidedit was time to end feudalism.So won't capitalism end just whenevera new economic system overtakes it?I don't think that's the kind of thingthat can be accomplished by a small group of activists.And I say small group because, I'm sorry to break it to you,but the vast majority of Americans are not communists.I think a lot of Internet leftistshave a vastly overinflated senseof how big and important they are.I fall prey to this myself, like I was so sure that Berniewas gonna win the primary, in part because when I lookedat my timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of supportfor Bernie and contempt for the mainstream Dems.But what I was seeing,and what we're all seeing on our feeds,is a finely curated and very unrepresentative sampleof the population.You have to remember that only 22%of Americans use Twitter at all.Most users rarely tweet,and 80% of tweets come from 10% of users.So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans.And it's not a representative 2%.According to Pew Research,Twitter users differ from the general populationin that they're, on average, younger,more likely to identify as Democrats,more educated and higher income.And far-left hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller,even more unrepresentative sample within a sample.We're talking about less than 0.1% of Americans.And that less than 0.1% does have an outsize influencebecause they're prolific Tweetersand their tweets get seen by public figureswho use the platform, which is why there's so much discourseabout cancel culture even though cancel culture is producedby a relatively tiny group of people.So if you wanna understandwhy even Democratic politicians caterto this retrograde soft conservatism,you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaignand I enraged people's dogs by knocking on their doorsand ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls.And I really recommend that leftists try doing thisfor at least one election,even though it is the worst thing in the worldand I hated it so much.You know, you have to listen to a lot of,\"I don't want Barack Hussein Obummer\"redistributing my wealth!\"Okay Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama's not sendinghis death panels after your landscaping businessbut whatever.Talking to voters teaches you the hard realitiesof what your fellow Americans actually care about.And when I was canvassing,I did talk to some left-wing people,I talked to union families,but I don't think I talked to a single communist.Most people do not read theory.Most people are concerned primarilywith themselves and their families.They want personal security and prosperity.And if you look at the talking points used by politicians,they reflect that.It's why the right hammers on about ANTIFA so much,because it works.Most people are afraidfor their personal property and safety.And this idea of ANTIFA looters and riots,it scares the shit out of people.Of course, in reality ANTIFA is not scary.Like I've met ANTIFA, and ANTIFA...ANTIFA is Ryan.It's Ryan and his transgender furry anarchist friends.But look if what you want is socialismor even just social democracy,then you have a lot of work ahead of youin terms of outreach.You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness.But you don't wanna do thatbecause it requires you to stop owning the libsand start actually communicating with them.You have to build alliances with Facebook momswho ask ignorant questionslike, \"What's indigenous peoples' day?\"And who think Kamala Harris making sassy facesis the height of praxis,and who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing!You can't let your radical queer friends catch youassociating with mainstream normie libs, how very bourgeois.- [Tabby] But revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.Okay, so you're saying that your planis to do a communist revolutionand overthrow the US government?That's very valid.That's super hecking valid.That's extremely valid.I mean I guess I admire the ambition.Uh, just a couple quick follow up questions though,are you counting on the US militaryand police taking the side of the communistsor is your plan to overpower them?Because unless you know something about the militarythat I don't, I don't think that much of the militaryis gonna defect to join a communist revolution.So there will have to be a war.Revolution doesn't happen overnight.After the Russian Revolution,there was the Civil War from 1917 to 1923,so you are gonna need to raise a Red Army.Well, you can't have a communist revolutionwithout a Red Army, right?So how's that going, Tabitha?How many weapons have you amassed?How many units have you trained?Why are we talking about this?Why am I even entertaining this notion?When the far-right talks about violenceand overthrowing the government, they actually mean it.And you know they mean itbecause they have literal militias,the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo boys,they're stockpiling weapons and training to use them.They have ex-military men in their ranksand connections to white supremacistswithin the police and military.Whereas when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter,it strikes me as ideation, not intent.Psychiatrists have this distinctionbetween two kinds of suicidal thinking.So there's intent which is when you have a planfor how you're gonna do it,and then they have to commit you'cause you're a danger to yourself.And then there's ideation,which is you're not actually gonna do itbut you just have that inner monologuethat's constantly saying \"I just wanna die.\"There's no joy for me left in this world.\"I just can't stand it anymore.\"I just wanna end it all.\"Then my psychiatrist says,\"Well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro.\"And I say, \"Not again doctor. Not again.\"So right-wing extremist discourse is violent intentwhile leftist radical discourse often amounts torevolutionary ideation.It's a kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics.- [Tabby] Well you can't plan a revolution.Revolution is the spontaneous reactionto intolerable injustice.- Yeah, so a riot is the language of the unheard.But what kind of language is it?What is the point of speaking through a riot,a protest or a strike?Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry?Or is the point not just to speak but to be heard?Heard by whomst?Who are you trying to persuade, the Globglogabgalab?No, you want be heard by people with power to change things.So it matters whether the people with powerare likely to listen.This year the US has seenone of the biggest protest movements in history.And what has that accomplished?Well, at the moment we have a president promisingto double down on law and order,on military police suppression,a president who told a room full of copsnot to be too gentle with people they arrest.- And when you see these thugs being thrownto the back of a paddy wagon,you just see them thrown in, rough.I said, \"Please don't be too nice.\"- And let's be clear, both Biden and \"Cop-mala\"have an ugly record when it comes to crime and policing.For most of his career, Biden called for more policing,which is the opposite of what we need right now.I'm right there with you Tabby-chan.But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourseabout policing and criminal justice.And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position.This years' Democratic platform includes thingslike stricter use-of-force standards,banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity,creating a registry of police misconduct,limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed,investing in crime prevention and social work.And is that good enough?No, it's not good enough.But it's a start, it's progress.It shows that the Democrats are, at least,willing to listen to protests.When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961,he didn't want to propose a civil rights billbecause that would've been super unpopularwith the Southern Democrats.But then 1963 happened and there were protests and uprisingsall over the south and the March on Washington that summer,and Kennedy listened.- The events in Birmingham and elsewherehave so increased the cries for equalitythat no city or state or legislative bodycan prudently choose to ignore them.- He was moved by the protests,and he responded by introducingwhat became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.But what if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963?What if some fascist had been president?What if Trump had been president?We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act.So it does matter who's president.It actually matters a lot.And please Tabby-chan,do not let a fascist win to own the libs.Goddamn it.Alright fam, let's open a new tab.Go to vote.gov and enter your state.And yeah, I know this is boringbut I'm trying to think about the tantrum Trumpis gonna throw when an entire nation rejects himand I'm letting that motivate me.In some states you can still register, so register nowif you still haven't.If you're voting in person, go to vote.organd find your polling place and make a planfor how you're gonna get there.Make sure your phone is chargedand you might wanna bring some snacks or even some friends.If you're like me, you need to set an alarmso you don't forget.And then just try not to get inconsolably highuntil after you've placed your vote.Because we're all living through a year of hell.And I, for one, think that we all deserveto begin 2021 by collectively purging from our livesthis swindling, pestilent doofus.Vote him out!(\"Lacrymosa, Mozart's Requiem\" by Papalin)\n"

      "(strumming guitar)- (sigh)Alright, so what are we looking at?What new hell have we sunk to nowhere in the United States of-- [Voiceover] They ask you how you areand you just have say that you're fineand you're not really finebut you just can't get into itbecause they would never understand—- Well, it's a Kentucky Police patrol carwith a blue lives matter, thin blue line,Punisher skull on the hood.Um...There's a lot to unpack here.But let's stick to traditionand begin by examining the skull.The skull is the symbol of \"The Punisher\",the Marvel comics' vigilante anti hero.The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglionebut he changed it to Frank Castle,I guess 'cause he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage.Disappointing.Frank Castle is an ex-Marinewhose wife and kids are murdered by the mob,leaving him an empty husk of a manwhose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.Nyaa.There's been a lot of TV and movie adaptationsof \"The Punisher\" and as research for this video,I did watch all of them.And my conclusion is that the best oneis the 1989 version where Dolph Lundgrendyes his hair black to pass as Sicilianand runs around naked and sweaty in the sewersworshiping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash.You know, just like the police do.(police chatter on radio)Hi, I'm Nyatalie.Creator of \"Catrapoints\"and no, I'm not a catgirl.I'm a catwoman.I'm sorry you're intimidated by that.Look I'm tired of only being valuedfor my petite, heterosexual body.I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother,as a wife and(piano music)as a woman with values.Just kidding, I'm trash.Let's talk about justice, uwu.Justice is when I get lots of head pats, nyaa—The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsterswho murdered his family.But once he gets revenge, he can't stop killingbecause it's the only thing that gives meaningto his shitty life.So he wages a one-man war on organized crime.But no matter how many bad guys he kills,it's never enough because new criminals just come alongand take the place of the old ones.It's like a cycle where violence begets violenceand nothing ever really changes.It's almost like this comic bookis trying to tell us somethingabout the nature of crime and punishment.But you know what?Let's not overthink this.Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car.Great. Perfect.- Are we the baddies?- Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these libtarded,ANTIFA-sympathizing, big government anarchistswho sits behind my iPhone with my latte,criticizing the police,even though I could never do a job 1/10as difficult as theirs.And to that I say,how dare you assume things that are entirely correct?This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.There's just nothing better than waking up in the morningand having the first doseof the chemical you're addicted to.They tried to make me go to rehab, I said,\"Nyaa, nyaa, nyaa.\"But you seem like a reasonable person,a person of science, a seasoned vendor,the free marketplace of ideas gorg.And as a reasonable person,I'm sure you wouldn't dismiss my argumentjust because I happen to enjoy head pats.As Socrates once said,\"Two plus two is four is equally truewhether uttered by a philosopher king or a peasant knave.\"Or a nekomimi.Kawaii desu!(laughs)Is this problematic?Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it.This is beyond cringe.This is cursed, children, cursed.So actually Socrates didn't say this quote,I just made it up butthat just proves the point I'm making.so maybe you should hear me out,nyaa.I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videosof police brutality are being shared on social mediaspurring on a movement to abolish police and prisons.And at the same time,there's a growing culture of online vigilantismwhere justice is taken into the hands of Twitter mobsdemanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.All of this raises a lot of questions, questions like,what should the consequences be for bad behavior?Who should impose these consequences?And under what circumstances and for what purpose?If we were to abolish police and prisons,what would take their place?Oh my god, these contacts.I'm literally doing a whole videowith f*cking sideways cat eyes.Ridiculous.Why don't we start with the basics and ask ourselves,what is justice, Socrates?It's a question philosophers have ponderedfor thousands of yearswith no conclusive answers.I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video'cause the philosophers were dummiesand I am very smart, nyaa.Ra ra Rasputin.One, revenge.\"The Punisher\" represents a particular ideaabout what justice issymbolized by the skull he wears on his t-shirtso the bad guys know they're about to get punished.\"The Punisher's view is that justicemeans harming people who harm people.An eye for an eye.This is called retributive justice.The idea that people who commit crimesdeserve punishment in proportion to their crime.It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice isbecause it's rooted in our instinctto strike back at someone who's harmed us.Social animals like humans and chimpanzeesoften practice revenge,probably because it serves an evolutionary function.If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananasand you don't get revengethen other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don't know,letting her boyfriend pick parasites out of your furthen that sends a message to the other monkeysthat it is not profitable to mess with you.So our little monkey brainshave evolved a taste for vengeance.And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us,our desire for retribution is strong.And our little monkey brainsreward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsiswhen justice of this kind is served.So of course there's a lot of content out theredevoted to scratching this itch.For example, there's a subreddit called r/JusticeServedwith 1 1/2 million subscribers.I first found JusticeServedwhen the popular feed showed me this postof two teenage thieves, stripped naked, humiliatedand photographed as punishmentand all this celebrated under the heading \"Police Justice.\"In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police,the description of the community was,now with 20% more police brutality!Fun fact, this ain't it, chief.Period, full stop.That's the tweet.Of course I subscribed to JusticeServed right away thinking,someone should be keeping an eye on these people.Here's a typical Justice Served post,woman sets P-E-D-O husband on fireafter catching him R-*-P-E seven-year-old daughtertitled, this man got what he deserved.Instant regret, predator exposed.To be honest, when I wrote this part of this script,I forgot I was gonna be wearing cat ears.I'm really out here trying to have a conversationabout immolating sex offenderswhile dressed like an agingbargain bin, Belle Delphine impersonator.Well, dress for the job you want.I mean, whomst amongst uswouldn't set their husband on fireunder those circumstances, right?Let's look at the comments on that post though.Let's read the room.She's a hero in my opinion.Should have had it live on television.Give her a medal.Give her two medals.So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze,but you know, there's always a couplebuzzkills in there whining as usual about\"oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering onburning people alive with no due processand no evidence.\"\"Lots of men like to f*ck my wife'cause I'm too busy crying about due process\"But those people get shouted down pretty fast.They get called pedo-symps.(laughs) Pedo-symps.So JusticeServed is a communityfor people to gather togetherand bond over our shared love of extra-judicial violence.But of course there's always someonewho takes it a little too far.On this video of a thief being kicked in the headuntil his face is a bloody pulp,one commenter says, \"That's a justice boner for me.I dream of the day I catch the thievesthat stole from me and kick the life out of them.\"Criminal fail, prank gone wrong.So when the righteous zeal for justicebecomes the cloak of blood lust,that is off-putting to some people.As one disgruntled former JusticeServed subscriber put it,I wanted to see stories and videos of assholesgetting their comeuppance.Instead I got bombarded with an angry,toxic, moral absolutism.Everything is black and white with them.If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair,then you must support giving them a slap on the wristand letting them fuck your wife.Unsubscribed.But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch\"videos of assholes getting their comeuppance.\"I think pretty much everyone is capableof enjoying some version of this type of content.There's a lot of sub genres.You've got Justice Porn,Play Stupid Games Win Stupid Prizes,Instant Karma,Bad Parking Revenge, Predator Poaching.- Why don't you just shoot me?Serial killer sentenced to deathand the whole train clapped,instant justice was served,karma fails,stupid people getting what they deserved, karma!A lot of this content haskind of a right wing feel to it.Unmarked police justice,criminal gets shot after fighting cop,home invader takes shotgun blast to the balls,Arizona, just Arizona.What about more is there to say?Arizona.Justice served, punished.It reminds me of NRA peoplewho spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about howthey're gonna kill home intruderswith the gun they keep in the bathroom.But I don't think this longing for retributionis distinctively right-wing.Left-wing people have the exact same emotional response.They just have it in different situations.Think about the jubilation on Twitterwhen they get a racist Karen fired.Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black manin front of an apartment building?Karma.And she got her husband fired.Dumb bitch really should have minded her business.Love to see it.She will probably end up with community service and a fine,but I would love to see her in jail for at least six months.Firing them was not enough.Life in prison!(laughs) Life (clap) in (clap) prison (clap)!An example I personally enjoyis that video of Daniel Holtzclaw,the cop who abused his powerto sexually assault a series of Black women,crying in court as he's sentencedto serve 263 years in prison.He just cannot believethat he's actually facing consequences for this.And of course there was the much savored vigilante punchingof N-A-Z-I Richard Spencer.Let's watch it now.Please try not to enjoy this.Remember, this is purelyfor educational, monetizable purposes.- It's uh Pepe, he's become kind of a symbol-(crowd noises)- That was informative. But let's be honest,the reason that video was so popularis people just enjoyed watching an N-A-Z-Iget what he deserves.Justice served.Punished.Smashing.Very happy gay sounds, uwu.Remember to smash Subscribe.So this punitive, retributive impulse,no matter how righteous it feels,is still basically a situational form of sadism,of schadenfreude.The satisfaction of justice servedis the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessingthe suffering of someone who deserves it.Now the phrase \"deserves it\"is doing a lot of work here.The correct use of that phrase is the differencebetween a morally well-adjusted personand someone who's hiding bodies in the crawl space.It puts the lotion on its skin, nyaa.But people generally agreethat those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.It's why we love stories about revenge.Stories like \"Mean Girls\", \"The Crow\",\"Old Boy\", \"Titus Andronicus\" and \"Matilda\".- Much too good for children!Revenge is such a popular plot linebecause it's easy for people to identifywith a revenge-seeking protagonist.And it's just the easiest way to hype people upabout spectacles of violence.This technique was used in one of the first books ever,\"The Odyssey\" by Homer.I stole this copy from my high schooland I stole this copy from my college.I still just read the SparkNotes.Well, let's read it now.See, I knew this would be useful someday.God, he's such a f*ckboy.What does Athena see in this man?He must be really hot.Okay, I'm ready for my book report.So the hero of the story is Odysseusand the whole book is him trying to get hometo the island of Ithaca after...Okay, so in the prequel,Odysseus' shitty friend, Menelaus throws a tantrumafter his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guyshe was actually attracted tohow dare she?So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to warinstead of doing what any normal man would doand blowing off some steam at a Femboy Symposium.Anyway, when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca,he finds that his house is full of menwho are eating his food and drinking his wineand trying to marry his wife.So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here,he murders all of his wife's suitors as paybackand then he rounds up all the slave womenwho slept with the suitors and he has them all hanged.And there's one suitor, Melanthius,Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his earsand nose and feetand then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.And reading this, I guess I find myself askingwas this really necessary?Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer ismaybe workshop this?I mean, super unlikable protagonist,really kind of kills it for me.I guess it's a male protagonistand you can get away with making them unlikable'cause men love hearing about assholes.That's why they watch my channel.But the crazy thing isI don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitorsand to his uh... his slaves.Yikes, disappointing.Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves.It isn't a good look.Wow, this blew up.I don't have a SoundCloud, give me money-Oh my God, this contact is fully horizontal.This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts.F*ck this!It just seems disproportionate, you know.Like it's not even an eye for an eyebecause the suitors didn't kill anyone.They were basically just rude to Odysseus.But I guess you have to understandthis kind of thing in cultural context.They came into his homeand they disrespected his wifeand probably she was into itbut whatever, we'll play along.So that was an affront to Odysseus' honor.And on the island of Ithacain the year 1000 BC or whatever,honor was everything.Because this was a pre-legal society.No laws, no courts, no cops,school's out, f*ck 12.(airhorn blast)So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation.And that's what kept people from stealingand lying and murdering each other.Though it was alsooften the thing causing them to murder each other.Because back then honor was the only thing protecting peoplefrom being taken advantage of.If you're an ancient Mycenaean Kingand someone invites themselves into your houseand drinks your wine and seduces your wife,well, you can't let them get away with that.'Cause then people will walk all over you.So you need to get revenge to protect your honor,to maintain your reputationas a person who is not to be messed with.It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.Hard masculinity is a defensive posture,an intimidating posture.It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.We call it toxic masculinity nowbecause in our society, it's destructive and dysfunctional.We've moved beyond the need for this,which is why it's possible for me to exist.If society collapses and we go backto Achilles in Odysseus,I'm in danger.I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.Back in Homer's time, I'd be,well, I'd be a slave at Femboy Symposium.Extremely sad gay sounds, nyaa.But for people in situationswhere appealing to community or state law enforcementis not an option such askings of ancient Mediterranean islandsor gangsters who need to resolve conflictsoutside of the law,or wild west cowboys,hard masculinity has a function.It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt,or the stripes on a poisonous snake.And the poison is vengeance,justice served.So revenge is arguablythe most basic form of retributive justice.The philosopher Francis Bacondefined revenge as a \"wild justice,\"according to the first paragraphof the Wikipedia article about revenge.Research! I am very smart, nyaa.But in most modern legal systems,revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind,didn't you know that?If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him,then his family is gonna try to get revenge by killing you.It's a cycle, a cycle of smashing.At the end of \"The Odyssey\",the families and the suitors Odysseus killedband together and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.And literally the last thing that happens in the Odysseyis that the goddess Athena,who has an inexplicable lady boner for Odysseus,steps in and saves himby just making the families forgetthat Odysseus killed their children.So only divine intervention and amnesiastops the cycle of violence.But in reality, that doesn't happen very much.So these cycles can last for decades or even centuries.In Albania, there's an ancient code called The Kanunwhich requires a family to commit murderin order to preserve their honorwhen another family offends against them.Life for life, blood for blood.This historically led to blood feudsbetween families that could last for generations.And in fact, it still sometimes happensin parts of Northern Albania.There's documentaries on YouTubeabout families who are trapped at home,possibly for the rest of their lives,because there's a vendetta against themand if they leave the house, they'll be murdered.Historically, blood feuds ledto a high mortality rate for young men,which may have contributed to the traditionof what are called Albanian sworn virgins.These are assigned female at birth peoplewho would take a vow of chastity in exchangefor getting to live as men.There's still some of them around,and in a very patriarchal societythey're socially recognized as men,allowed to wear men's clothes,use a male name uwu,act as head of a household, inherit family wealth,and generally have the rights and privileges of a man.Extremely happy trans sounds uwu.I bring this up just because I think it showshow devastating the blood feuds must've been.Because only desperation would lead a European countryhundreds of years ago to support trans rights.No one wants that so you know it was a last resort.- Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender, most were compelled to provide-- Yeah, I know that sweaty.It was just a jokeokay calm down.Revenge cycles also happen on a larger scalebetween communities, nations, ethnicities, religions.I'm worried if I give a real example,I'll be canceled for seeming neutralabout a conflict where I'm supposed to take a side.So, in the interest of cowardice,let's say that the cat girlsbomb the dog girls and then the dog girlsbomb the cat girlsand that cycle repeats for a few decades.And by that point, both nations have such a longand bitter list of grievances against each otherthat reconciliation is close to impossible.Extremely angry gay sounds, nyaa.So a revenge-based code of honoris not really an ideal justice system.It's bloody, it's chaoticand it produces these endless cycles of violence.So at some point in the growth of a civilization,something has to be done to control the chaoscaused by vengeance.And the most popular way to do thatis to create a state legal system.Two, retribution.The extremely heckin cute and valid German sociologistMax Weber defined the state as the organizationwith a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.In an honor society with no rule of law,anyone is allowed to kill someoneas long as they do so in accordance with the code of honor.But once you have the state,usually only the government is allowed to kill people.In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabiwho enacted one of the first law codesin the world around 1750 BC,an era that scholars refer to as History Times.The code of Hammurabi looked like this.The laws were crudely scratched into the stoneusing some primitive attempt at writing.I mean, it was like a thousand years ago soI'm sure they were doing their best.It's very good, sweetie.I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.I was expecting this replica to be bigger,sort of a Spinal Tap \"Stonehenge\" situation.The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall,and they were publicly placed in the cityso that everyone knew what the laws were,even though most people were illiteratebut, hey, they tried sort of.Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.That's content, right?Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi, nyaass queen!We don't deserve rights (laughs).So there's 282 laws and they're all in if-then form,so if you do X, then the punishment is Y.Law 22, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught,then he shall be put to death.That's extremely valid.If a son of a paramour or prostitute sayto his adoptive father or mother,\"You are not my father or my mother\",his tongue shall be cut off.At least they're standing up for adoptive parents.If a man put out the eye of another man,his eye shall be put out.Now we're getting into some of the classics.If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.If a freed man strike the body of another freed man,he shall pay 10 shekels in money.But if the slave of a freed manstrike the body of a freed man,his ear shall be cut off.Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.So it's like our legal system, except honest.If a builder build a house for someoneand does not construct it properlyand the house which he built fall inand kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.If it killed the son of the owner,the son of that builder shall be put to death.Love that.Okay, so by modern standards,the code of Hammurabi,it does not pass the vibe check.The vibrations are very negative.It's a lot of cutting people's hands offand burning them alive.Just a major vibe killer all around.But you have to credit Hammurabi's codefor resolving the problem of honor-driven revenge cycles.You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you,instead of retaliating against their familyand potentially starting a generations long blood feud,you take your grievance to the elders of the citywho reach a verdict and impose a sentence, justice served.So the involvement of a neutral third partyis one major difference between vigilante revengeand a state legal system of retributive justice.Let's list all the differences.Revenge is personal in the sense that it's the victimwho does the avenging.It's often emotional, an act of passion.It can be disproportionate, as in Odysseuskilling the suitors for squatting in his palace.And it's sadistic, it's satisfying to the avenger.Revenge is sweet.On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justiceis impersonal in the sense that the punishmentis imposed by a third party,the state, and not the victim.It's therefore disinterested,so not in theory motivated by emotionand also lacking the sadism of sweet revenge.It's also proportionate, again, in theory.You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal,but it's an eye for an eye and no more than an eye,and that could be considered humanecompared to say,revenge killing someone's family for an eye.And it's also consistent.So different offenders are supposedto get the same punishment for the same crime.I mean, unless you're rich,in which case, don't you even worry your little headabout it, just pay some gold, it's fine.Girl, these contacts, like-(ominous music)So there are supposed to be these differencesbetween revenge and retributive justice.Which is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcementto identify with the outlaw Punisher.Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goalwhile rejecting revenge as lawless.However, I feel that retributive justiceis still spiritually akin to revenge.It scratches the same emotional itch.It's basically revenge by proxy.If revenge is wild justice,then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral orderof things, to balance out the karmaby harming the person who caused harm,sometimes in a poetic justice kind of way.Like in the code of Hammurabi,there's this symbolic retaliationof punishing the body part that you offended with,cutting off the hand that struck the father,cutting off the breasts of the wet nursewho switched the babies,cutting out the tongue that renounced its parents.There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this,an appreciation the this symmetry of punishment and crime.For a modern example, here's a poetic justice postfrom r/instantkarma.\"Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots onlineand then demands payment to take them down.The site's founders were just arrested for extortion.Here are their mugshots.\"There's something metaphysically pleasantabout poetic justice,this sense of beautiful cosmic harmony.And my guess is that this way of thinking originatesin some primeval human instinctthat's difficult to get rid of.But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it.The logic of retribution has been questionedfor thousands of years by philosophers,reformists, messiahs, you know,fancy people who think they're too good to enjoy violence.One school of anti-retribution thoughtwe could call the love and forgiveness school.And the main love and forgiveness guyis a preachy lib you may have heard ofcalled Jesus of Nazareth.Back in Bible times,the Hebrews had laws of retributive justicethat were similar to the code of Hammurabi.Like in the book of Exodus,God gives a bunch of laws to Mosesincluding some relaunches of Hammurabi classics.Viewers at home may now open up your Biblesto Exodus 21:22.If people are fighting and hit a pregnant womanand she gives birth prematurely,but there is no serious injury,the offender must be finedwhatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows.But if there is serious injury,you are to take life for life,eye for eye, tooth for tooth,hand for hand, foot for foot,burn for burn, wound for wound,bruise for bruise.Headpats for headpats.Welcome to catgirl Bible study, nyaa.Extremely devotional gay sounds, uwu.I feel very spiritually aroused right now.My third eye chakra? Dripping.Macaroni in a pot.(Macaroni stirring sound)I need Jesus. I'm so sorry.So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked.It's basically an eye for an eye,don't be a homo, you know,basic common sense.But then Jesus comes alongand he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness.In Matthew 26:52,a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrestedafter Judas betrays himbut Jesus says,\"Put your sword back in its place, Spartacus.All who draw the sword will die by the sword.\"Now, some people read that as sayingthat violence begets violence and should be renouncedeven to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself,which is peak radical centrism.Denying the right of marginalized peopleto defend themselves?Rethink this.It gets worse.In the sermon on the mount, Jesus says,\"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\"Love your enemies? But I don't wanna love my enemies.No loving, smashing!But maybe, Jesus wasn't as literal-minded as that.You know, religion is a very subjective thingand I have my own Bible interpretations.And my personal viewis that a lot of what Jesus saysis actually sarcasm.Like, consider Matthew 5:38.Why is no one talking about Matthew 5:38?Jesus says, \"You've heard that it was said,an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.But I say to you, do not resist an evildoer.But if anyone's strikes you on the right cheek,turn the other also.\"Think of the dramaof what he's asking you to do here.Someone strikes you across the faceand you go, \"Uhhhh.\"This is not pacifism.This is passive aggression,some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.This is the Christianity of,okay, well, I'll pray for you.But if you do take Jesus at face valuethen I would argue that his endorsement of loveand forgiveness as a response to wrongdoing,is not justice at all.It's an alternative to justice.In the absence of justice,forgiveness is an emotional unburdeningof the resentment and angerthat victims of injustice experience.And religion often provides this release,instructing people not to worry too muchabout serving earthly justice,because justice is really God's business,and he'll take care of that when the day of judgment comes.It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhismthere's the idea of karma,which is like a cosmic law of moral cause and effectthat exists independently of any God or human institution.You reap what you sow basically, somaybe don't worry about injustice too much'cause karma will take care of it.This kind of thinking is sometimes calledthe just world fallacy,the cognitive bias that sees the worldas inherently fair and good.\"Everything happens for a reason.\"If something really horrible happens,like a child is murdered, people say,\"There's a special place in God's kingdomfor little angels taken up so soon.\"And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to helland being an*lly demolished by fire demons or whatever.People reassure themselves like thisbecause it relieves the stressof enduring unresolved injustice.In the Bible, the book of Jobdeals with the problem of injustice.Why do bad things happen to good people?And the answer is, just don't worry about it.It's part of God's plan.It'll all work out in the end.It's fine. Everything's fine.The alternative is being burdened with the awarenessthat the world is just kind of very not good.In which case you might start getting ideas in your headabout, I don't know, maybe changing some things.I guess I should disclaimer that #NotAllReligionand obviously many political activistshave been influenced by faith.But let's put a pin in that for now.Three, utilitarianism.So there's also a secular traditionof anti-retribution thinkingwhich tries to define justiceas something other than retaliation.Utilitarian reformists have arguedthat the goal of criminal justiceshould be to improve societyrather than punishment for punishment's sake.Utilitarianism is the moral theory which saysthat the right thing to dois whatever causes the highest ratio of human happinessto human suffering.So the utilitarian approach to punishmentlooks forward at preventing future crimes,where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes,revenge by proxy.Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence,punishing criminals as an incentive for othersnot to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons,or rehabilitation of criminals,trying to educate or discipline themso that they can reenter society.A lot of people consider these utilitarian goalsto be more rational and scientific than retribution,which is very based in emotions.Also the utilitarian idea of justice makes senseeven if you don't believe in free will.Cause retribution really only makes senseif you believe that people freely choose their actionsand are therefore culpable for their behaviorand can be deserving of punishment.Because punishing someone for somethingthey didn't meaningfully choose seems, well...The Greek historian Herodotus tells a storyabout the Persian King Xerxesordering the sea to be whipped with 300 lashesafter a storm destroyed his bridge.Which seems irrational, right?To punish a force of nature.Leave my beautiful wet wife alone!It's debatable how free humans are,like we're at least partially products of our genetics,our environment, our upbringing,our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venusin our natal chart,dry, oily or combination.And modern criminal sentencing triesto take all of that into consideration.Like you might get a lighter sentence if you argue that,you know, your mother never took you to Disneyland,it was a crime of passion.Through no fault of my own,I was high on bath saltsat the time of the tax evasion, your honor.A lot of the language around punishmentin our legal system is utilitarian.Like, prisons are called \"correctional facilities\"and not \"retribution cages.\"But \"correctional facilities\" is a euphemismbecause the fact is,these facilities are not doing very much correcting.I'm sorry.In the United States, 2/3 of released prisonersare rearrested within three years,and 76% are rearrested within five years.And just think about the way we talk about incarceration.Like if someone really evil gets a long sentence,we say, \"Good, I hope he rots in prison.\"Like when was the last time you heardabout a criminal sentencing and someone said,\"Good, the proven efficacy of our correctional facilitieswill rehabilitate this manand release him a contributing member of his community.\"So even the institutions we have,they are supposed to serve a correctionalor rehabilitative functionare still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.I think the problem with utilitarianism is thatwhile it's very rational,it's often offensive to human emotions.And you can say facts don't care about your feelings,we shouldn't be basing our legal systemon whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind.And I agree with you, but the fact remains,if someone hurts your child,you don't wanna rehabilitate him.You wanna set him on fire.And this disconnectbetween the legal system and human emotionaffects law enforcement too.A YouTuber called Jose has a video called\"Why Some Cops Think They're The Punisher,\"which argues that some copsand soldiers admire \"The Punisher\"because they relate to his military backgroundwhile fantasizing about the moral simplicityof his vigilantism.Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fanswho say things like, \"Castle doesn't see shades of grey,which, unfortunately, the American justice systemis littered with and which tends to slow downand sometimes even hinder victims of crimefrom getting the justice they deserve.Frank Castle is the ultimate definitionof Occam's razor for the military.Don't worry about uniforms, inspectionsor restrictive rules of engagement.Find the bad guys.Kill the bad guys.Protect the innocent.Any true warrior?That's the dream.\"So these cops and soldiers feel crampedby rules of engagement and use of force restrictionsthat are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.You know, law enforcement would be a lot easierif it weren't for all these pesky laws.There's a childish simplicity and dualismto this moral worldview.Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys.Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoricabout how you need a good guy with a gunto stop a bad guy with a gun.They sound like eight-year-old boysplaying Cops and Robbers.\"Good guys and bad guys.\"That's my impression of an eight year old boy.And to be fair,I totally understand the appeal of moral simplicity.People love Justice Servedand Instant Karma videos for a reason.We take satisfaction in swift, decisive,elegant retribution.But the procedures of law enforcementand criminal justice don't allow for that.There's all these tedious roadblocks.Right to an attorney,right to remain silent,right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence.A lot of police wish they could simplify thingsby being judge, jury, and executioner.But the function of police is supposed to be limitedto making arrests and initiating criminal investigations.They're not supposed to be walking avatarsof karma dispensing free-form retributionin the streets at will,justice served,Now with 20% more police brutality.But a lot of people defend the policewhen they behave like thisbecause the thin-wristed civiliansare just as emotionally frustratedby due process as the cops.Wow did I just say \"All Lives Are Bastards?\"I'm double canceled.Well look, all lives are bastardsbut only some bastards are armed by the stateand licensed to go bastarding around town.The rest of us have to be bastards on our off-time.I also think there's a secular versionof the just world fallacy going on here.People like to think that if the police kill somebody,it must be because that person did something wrong.Karma at work, justice served.Victim blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy,you get what you deserve soif something bad happens to you,you must have been asking for it.And obviously racism is a huge part of this.You know, there's the structural white supremacythat occupies Black neighborhoods with policeinstead of investing in communities,and people are prejudiced and more likelyto think of Black people as criminal thugsand therefore deserving of police violence.So we get this \"no angel\" discourse that comes upevery time a Black person is murdered by the police,where they bring up the victim's criminal recordor a picture of them looking like a scary thug,as if that proves they deserved to die.The problem with this, of course,is that no one is an angel.There are no angels walking this earth.We're all flawed,we've all made mistakes,we've all done bad things.That doesn't mean we deserve to die a violent death.And then there's people like Breonna Taylorand Elijah McClain who as far as we knowwere about as close to angels as humans come,but that didn't protect them.Though that is 100% beside the pointbecause Black people in Americashould not literally have to havewhite feather wings and glowing halosto deserve not to be murdered by the police.In fact, people of all races have the absolute rightto be low life, drug addicted, petty criminalswho contribute absolutely nothing to societyand yet still not be executed by the copsbecause that's what it's supposed to meanto live in a free country.So, things need to change.The Punisher police have got to go,and a lot of the rest of our justice system with them.We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice.And to be honest,that might take more than one YouTube video.I know at the beginning I said I was gonna explainwhat justice is, but...I lied.I'm sorry that I can't fix America.I'm just a lonely cat.I guess the only solution is... revolution.And by revolution, I do mean vote Democratand then bully the Democrats into actually doing something.And if they don't listen,well...(phone rings)Hang on, let me get this.Moshi moshi?Heyhowareyou desu!(hiss)♪ \"Catgirl Army\" by

       "'“You will not replace us! You will not replace us!”“Blood and soil! Blood and soil!”“White lives matter! White lives matter!\"“Excuse me.What about the Alt-Left that came charging at the, as you say, the Alt-Right?Do they have any semblance of guilt?”“A local World War II veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he’sworried what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the UnitedStates.”“He believes what happened—”Scheiße!Hi.In this video, I’m going to talk about How to Recognize a Fascist.[80s intro music]To begin, let’s take a look at what fascism is.Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs:1: People of European heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural and politicalunity known as the white race—sometimes dog-whistled as “Western culture”.2: Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalismand non-white immigration, a plot that fascists call “white genocide” or “ethnic replacement.”3: The only way to save the white race is to establish a “white homeland,” or “ethnostate,”from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged.Now, as I’ve argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false.So what is it that\\'s attracting people to fascism?Well, let’s take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figurethat out.“Who are you?I’m not talking about your name or your occupation, I’m talking about somethingbigger, something deeper.I’m talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny.Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity.They could say ‘I’m a Roman,’ ‘I’m a Saxon,’ ‘I’m a Dane.’”Good news, boys.You no longer have to be some schlubby fuck sadly riding the escalator at Ikea and thinkinghow much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate, because thesun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father’s claymore in hand and defendVoltaire and adorable blonde children against black civil rights, you know, just like theVikings did!“We’re often told that being an American, or a Briton, or a German, or any European nationalityis about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords: democracy, freedom,tolerance, multiculturalism.But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.”So, life is basically sad, and in capitalist society, that sadness is a sense of isolation,an anxiety that there’s nothing more to life than acquiring 1990s collector’s editionTampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim beer steins until you die.Fortunately, thanks to Fascism, you don’t have to.Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself.A homeland for your people!A sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years, and as far into thefuture—just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buyingand selling other human beings as property.The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is.The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to the establishinga white ethnostate is just nonsense.Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever you get off to is in noway impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions.And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all becomethe same thing.But in order to recognize fascism you need to do a lot more than reject the most overtpropaganda.In the wake of the disastrous Alt-Right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month, theNazis have been driven back into the shadows.At least two of their major websites were shut down, confederate monuments were removedall over the country, and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling.None of this means fascists will go away, it just means they’ll have to be more subtleand indirect.Shortly after the Charlottesville rally, a post titled “Fixing the Alt-Right” appearedon /pol/, the imageboard where Millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures ofJapanese nymphets.The post outlines some basic fascist strategy.“Don’t get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies.Pretending that Charlottesville didn’t massively push the average white person away is reallystupid.We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the Overton windowto the right, but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the AVERAGEwhite person.”And the way to do that is:“Disavow all Nazi/KKK edgelord LARPers.There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes andholding Tiki torches while chanting ‘Jews will not replace us.’This instantly makes the average person hate you.”“Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental overt goals.Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigrationand prioritizes white immigration is an actual tangible political goal.”“Keep the long-term goals covert, and don’t ever reveal your power level.Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turningagainst you, so disavow anyone who reveals his power level.Leftists will recognize dog whistles and know we’re crypto, but normies won’t listento them.”So at first glance this seems like a really silly, juvenile post that references Dragonball Z,but it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach tolong-term goals that I wish were more common on the left.But of course the strategy described here isn’t new.Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades.When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language inorder to appeal to racists.Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981:“You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘N—.’By 1968, you can\\'t say ‘n—’—that hurts you.Backfires.So you say stuff like forced busing, states\\' rights and all that stuff.You\\'re getting so abstract now that you\\'re talking about cutting taxes, and all thesethings you\\'re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacksget hurt worse than whites.”So if you want to recognize a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext, and howto hear dog whistles, because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism,and white supremacy, at least when they’re talking to you, a non-fascist.Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule.Fascists are more likely to gain traction, and are hence more dangerous, when they usesubtler tactics.So for the rest of this video, I’ll be describing the particular strategies that fascists useto code their ideas, and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals.Strategy 1: Outright Denial“Never reveal your power level.Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.”This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talkingpoints, and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascismshould be worth absolutely nothing to you, and shouldn’t even enter into your considerationof whether they’re a fascist.After all, “I’m not a fascist” is exactly what a fascist would say.Strategy 2: Euphemism“ Of course I’m not a fascist, I’m an alternative Euro-nationalist simply tryingto preserve Western values.”Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations that developaround the names of their movements whenever people figure out what they really are.So they insist they aren’t Nazis or white supremacists—just “white nationalists,”or “Alt-Right.”But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the Alt-Right are just Nazis,they’ll shift their terminology again and start telling you:“I’m not a white nationalist, I’m an identitarian.”Or whatever the next thing is.But it’s still the same bastards, they’re just using a different name.They’ll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs.If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist, they’lltalk about preserving “Western civilization” or “Western culture” instead.If the phrase “white genocide” discredits them, they’ll say “ ethnic replacement”instead.And if it’s considered hate speech to want to purge non-white people, they’ll talkinstead about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists—and leave it tothe audience to catch the color-coding on their own.Strategy 3: Pedantry“It’s absurd to call me a Nazi, the German National Socialist Party hasn’t existedsince 1945.”That’s right, and I bet he’s an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis.Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels and also just tobog you down in a petty terminological dispute.This is a good way to waste your time and divert attention away from whatever led youto call them a Nazi in the first place.“I’m not a white supremacist, I don’t think that whites are superior to otherraces, I simply think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.”There it is again.And next he’s gonna tell us that since Asians have the highest IQs, he’s, if anything,an Asian supremacist.And then you’ll get sucked into arguing about IQ instead of talking about the factthat the main goal of the politics he supports is the political and social supremacy of whitepeople over all other Americans and Europeans.In other words, white supremacy.Strategy 4: Secret SymbolsNazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the Black Sun on Fritz’s ring,or like the swastika itself, but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secrethandshake that lets Nazis recognize each other, without normies taking notice.The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not generally associated withfascism, or at least have some other meaning, such as the Othala rune or the iron cross.Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous.Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod ateach other, notably the frog (after pepe), the milk, and the OK sign.So it doesn’t matter what the symbols are.In fact it’s important that the symbols constantly change, so that normies don’tcatch on.By the time you watch this video, they probably won’t even be using the frog anymore.Maybe it’ll be this.Or this.The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use toidentify themselves.And, of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists tryto point those symbols out, the fascist can always say:“ These gullible SJWs now think that even the ok sign is racist.Is there anything they don’t think is racist?”And the gullible centrists will be taken right in.The poor centrists.They’re so worried that Antifa is going to punch them because of their hair or theiremoji.And, you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots, so I should say, you should neverassume someone is a fascist just because of their hair or the emoji they use.These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle.But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at politicalrallies—oh god what if they profile me and attack me unfairly—that’s how a lot ofblack people feel about the police all the time.And the fascists whose free speech you defend so often are trying to drum up exactly thesentiments that make the police dangerous to black people, and that make it dangerousfor queer people to be themselves in public.So, I hope that’s something you think about.Anyway, it’s not that the ok sign is inherently racist or that anyone who uses it is racist,and in fact it’s its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist winkand nudge.But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist sets the stage for:Strategy 5: Camaraderie of the Accused“The left accuses everyone of racism.They think all white people are Nazis.If it’s acceptable to attack and censor me, they’ll come for you next.”Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility toward “social justicewarriors,” especially online.Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur’s eye for detecting fascism, and some of themdo throw the accusation at centrists or liberals.This doesn’t cause centrists to become allied with fascists—history shows that happensregardless—but it can accelerate the process, lending some plausibility to the fear thatmoderate centrists have that anti-fascists will come after them next.It’s tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation, and use it topump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists.Strategy 6: “Irony,” “Jokes,” “Satire,” and “Memes”“Of course I wasn’t actually being racist.It was just an edgy meme.Can’t anyone take a joke anymore, or will the Antifa fascists violently attack you overhumor now too?”Here’s a uniquely Millennial twist on the racist dog-whistle.You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes, and then when called out, you mockyour accuser for being a clueless normie who isn’t in on the joke.Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you’re not quite ready to ownyet.Before I realized I was transgender, I used to jump at any opportunity to crossdress “ironically.”So when you see people joking about being Nazis, they could be just joking, or theycould be using irony to partially conceal the truth.It’s difficult to tell the difference, and that’s the point.“But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.”Well, it’s a hilarious satire of civil rights movements that just happens to use a Nazi battle flag.And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers, who are unableor unwilling to see how helpful they’re being to fascists, Kekistan became the perfectpseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians, including the ones who led the rally wherean edgy shitposter hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people.No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol.“Pff those normie fools.It’s just a joke.”Strategy 7: Shifting Blame“Why doesn’t the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations like BlackLives Matter or Antifa?”This is essentially just a tu quoque fallacy, especially heinous because of the equivocationbetween fascist violence and anti-fascist violence, and between white nationalism andblack civil rights.The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against black peopleis just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing.Shortly after the Charlottesville incident, our proto-fascist president called out Antifaand the “Alt-Left,” a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists, and establishthe assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the Alt-Right.Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist.“Both sides” rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them,vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists, and helps to shift the center ofacceptable discourse in their direction.Strategy 8: Incrementalism“You don’t have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration.Of course I don’t support violence against the non-white people already here,but we do have a right to preserve our own boundaries and our culture, don’t we?”The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation, often aimedat representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people as a defense of whitepeople and “white culture.”The fascist’s long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate, which at some point will requiremassive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another.But of course they won’t tell you about that unless they think you’re also a fascist.The strategic fascist knows it’s better to start with realistic, achievable goals,and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration, something they’lltry to get you—the centrist, conservative, or liberal—on board with by emphasizingthe danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees.If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric, they can later turn thatenergy against the non-white people who are already here.Strategy 9: The Free-Speech Defense“You may not agree with what I say, but I have just as much a right to speak and assembleas anyone else.”Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascist’s ability to publicly recruit andintimidate, often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies, or by pressuring platformsnot to host fascists.The best way for the fascist to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal valueof free speech.Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silencedyou are.But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity.They only value the race, the people, the nation.Their long term goal is a society where there’s no room for anyone who isn’t white, or evenanyone who isn’t a fascist, to exist.So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms, but remember:you shouldn’t expect any reciprocity from them.They do not care about “diversity of opinions”—in fact they actively oppose it.That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation,and to garner sympathy from centrists.[drone]Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naïve about them: they don’tnotice dog whistles, and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt.Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with childrenwho don’t get sexual innuendo.There’s a whole hidden layer of meaning that they’re not picking up.This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easyto exploit.Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talkingpoints without intending to or realizing it.And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense.Now you might wonder: well, if fascists disguise themselves, and liberals inadvertently duplicatefascist memes, then isn’t just about everyone suspect?Aren’t you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi?Well, that’s what they want you to think!They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid.I’ll admit there are cases where I can’t tell if someone is genuinely Alt-Light, orif they’re just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points.Likewise, it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is Alt-Lightbut not an outright fascist, and a fascist who’s concealing their power level.So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid.The other day the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blond child with the caption,“this is the future ACLU members want,” and for a second I was like, what the fuck?Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme.But of course it’s unintentional, it’s the ACLU.“I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quickstatement.The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.But you don’t make statements that direct unless you know the facts.”Yes, I have become crazy.But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception is the psychologicalconsequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists andcommunicating in code.And it’s the intentional consequence of that.Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist’s psychological arsenal.So, how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies?I know if you’re a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists,it seems like the left all thinks you’re a Nazi and that we hate you, and I admit thatI am pretty frustrated with you right now—obviously.But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better atresisting fascism.Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning, so don’t feel guilty for fallingfor them, just try to get better at resisting.I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this: ifyou care about even one person of color, or queer person, or immigrant, stand up for thatperson by opposing the Alt-Right and its allies.Do not give them a platform.Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel.Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech, but they do not have a right to amegaphone, and you should not be giving them one.I know to a lot of you it just seems like the free marketplace of ideas, everyone expressingtheir ideas peacefully.But to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous, because ifthose ideas catch on, their lives are at stake.Now if you’re just an average person without a big platform, then you actually can debate,and you should be debating.Argue with your friends who are getting kinda Alt-Righty.Argue with your family, argue with your coworkers.Let them know that you don’t agree.Make them listen to a different perspective.And if you’re someone who’s gotten involved with the Alt-Right in the last couple yearsand is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group, youhave to get out now.It is not too late.Society will forgive you.If you don’t know how to leave, look up Life After Hate, an organization founded bya former neo-Nazi that helps people get out of hate groups.And as for all you lefties: na zdrowie!Keep up the good fight, comrades.[Star-Spangled Banner][synthwave][mysterious piano
